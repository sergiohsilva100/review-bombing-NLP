That being said\, I’ll start of by saying the game itself has a beautiful story filled with some unexpected turns. Sure there are some predictable moments\, but that is to be expected with any story. I thoroughly enjoyed the detailed firsthand experience of Deacon’s relationship with his wife and thought it was interesting how the game developers depicted the connection between the two. There was no sappy romance\, which would have been unfitting for a game of this genre\, but instead an underlying current to their entire relationship that is humorous and refreshingly subtle. I also enjoyed the array of character personalities found within the game. There are multiple authoritative characters all presented with different core elements to their personality; each behaves differently around the main character and each one has their own significance found in separate story lines. A necessity for games following a singular character is that players themselves need to be able to develop a sense of connection to the main character. Day’s Gone does this perfectly by creating a main character that is likable in every situation. Deacon never displays a lapse of his good moral judgment that would force the player to find themselves rooting against him nor does he ever behave in a way that would seem out of character. For those seeking diversity\, there are characters of color held in high esteem throughout the story\, some of whom are either leaders of their group or subtly radiate authoritative qualities. There are others who are strongly beneficial or necessary to their group even without the presence of leadership. There are women who either run a camp themselves or who benefit their groups drastically in such a way that their presence is essential. Another aspect that I found particularly enjoyable is the variety of enemies within the game. From rippers\, anarchists\, marauders\, and simple hostage situations to the different types of freakers\, there are plenty of enemies to face off against. Moving further away from the story itself\, there are plenty of things to do outside of the main gameplay. One can engage in plenty of side quests\, take on hordes of freakers\, explore undiscovered locations\, etc. There is no shortage of side quests\, exploration\, and adventure within the game. The graphics themselves are exquisite and contain a large amount of variety throughout each scene and location. Day’s Gone brings together the best aspects of similar games within its genre while still maintaining its own uniqueness and beauty. I firmly believe that Day’s Gone deserves more credit than is given and I would strongly recommend the game to anyone who is interested.… Expand",True,0.7031452655792236,0.4745696783065796,0.23029860854148865,0.9092841744422913,0.6603066921234131,0.7792989015579224,0.47860220074653625,0.8498000502586365,0.8010662198066711

81354,DG,2019-11-16,4.0,"To be honest\, when I played this game it was a bit of a letdown.There were several things that I didn't enjoy about this game mainly being: Deacon\, the development of characters\, and the oh so many glitches.In regards to Deacon\, I just found that he could be an extremely unlikeable protagonist. I can understand where he is coming from\, and why he acts the way he does\, but sometimes his decisions just go far past my line of logic. Being that we play as Deacon\, he is the one character who we will grow the most attached to\, and arguably our protagonist is always the one character we enjoy the most. However\, I found myself disagreeing with Deacon in many situations\, along with the way he treats other characters. Late in the game\, when you have to rescue Manny\, who was kidnapped from Copeland's camp\, Deacon at first refuses to help Cope out\, stating that it's none of his business. He only decides to help once Cope says that Manny has been kidnapped\, which sparked another issue. Deacon makes decisions without the input of the player\, and there are not many situations in which you can actually decide what Deacon does. One of these decisions is rescuing people from freakers\, for example. However\, this input from the player directly contrasts Deacon's character as he goes from helping strangers in one moment\, to refusing to help in another. The difference is that in one case the player has the choice\, and in the other Deacon calls all the shots. This leaves Deacon feeling incomplete\, as you can't make Deacon the kind of protagonist you want him to be\, which may cause you to dislike him. Finally\, he doesn't get much of a character ark. He starts off as a bit of a dick\, and even after finding Sarah\, he still continues to act like a dick. It's unsatisfying when a character pursues something\, and after pursuing that thing and getting it\, the character doesn't change\, as if they would be fine without them. His pursuit of Sarah also goes to show his odd actions\, as one day he goes to burn the church they got married in to forget about Sarah\, and the next he is going down into Militia territory hoping she's alive. He can make very rash decisions\, which he pays no mind to in the future\, which adds on to why I don't like him as my protagonist.Next\, the character development of the people we meet feels a bit lacklustre. To summarize\, it's incredibly obvious that Skizzo will betray you and Colonel Garrett is kindy crazy and will probably be the final enemy. Due to this\, I was thinking that it was so obvious that Skizzo would betray us that maybe the Developers would've tried something interesting and made him be a hero\, or at least not be as shady as he came off. But nope\, they didn't do that\, and almost anyone could see his betrayal coming from a mile away\, making his betrayal very underwhelming. For the Colonel\, it was also obvious that he was crazy\, and that we would have to face him at some point. What I didn't consider was that we\, in fact\, wouldn't face him and that there wouldn't even be a final boss. We killed Skizzo by mashing a button\, which was also pretty pathetic\, but we don't get any fight against Colonel. This leaves an empty feeling\, making you wonder \""Is this it?\"" when you see the Colonel die due to the poison Sarah puts in his tea. A final note would be Iron Mike. He tries to be a pacifist\, but we see that that line of thinking doesn't work. It takes him until he is at his death bed to realize that he was wrong\, which is an incredibly underwhelming end to an otherwise likeable character. I was expecting him to save Deacon when he fought the Militia by saying \""screw it!\"" to his pacifist ways and having a fistfight with the Colonel. But nope to that as well. Who cares if Deacon can get shot by a sniper rifle several times and still stand\, this guy can get shot once and die. However\, I will give them points for changing things up. It's been a while since I've played a game that has managed to lower my expectations as I played\, and lower them even further due to the lack of action. I was so hyped when I approached the end of the game\, thinking \""oh man there's going to be an awesome boss fight!\"". Nope. There\, in fact\, wasn't a boss fight\, like they had done earlier in the game\, and instead\, everything just ends and that's kind of just it.My last note would be glitches. Had glitches been the only issue\, this would've gotten an 8 from me. However\, when you have a game that is passed off as finished\, when there are still many glitches in it\, some more obvious than others\, you cannot excuse them. Some glitches were fine. Bike clipping into a truck bed? No problem. Doing some weird voodoo magic with throwables causing the game to glitch out? Not fine. It was my first horde in highway 97. I threw a Molotov\, some died\, I then couldn't fire my gun\, and they all diss engaged from me. This left me free to stealth kill 3/4 of a horde because they wouldn't acknowledge me.Overall this game was pretty bad.… Expand",True,0.8581202626228333,0.8308438062667847,0.645492672920227,0.8633129000663757,0.8525357842445374,0.7347331643104553,0.4343526065349579,0.850250244140625,0.6503574848175049

Poor reviews are very misleading.  Yes\, its formula is a bit generic\, reminiscent of The Last Of Us with the protagonist Deacon St John (Deek) on a journey of mid America surviving infected \""freakers\"" whilst crafting items and the such\, but I like these type of games; killing \""freakers\"" and baddies\, working for better weapon upgrades\, salvaging scrap for crafting\, going on side missions and main missions\, and ultimately following a main story with interesting characters and narrative.  It's not stellar 5/5 like The Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2\, but still a strong 4/5\, with an \""open world\"" map to explore and conquer.  I love the arsenal of weapons one can work towards purchasing\, all with their individual pros and cons\, and the unique structure of building \""trust\"" with different camps to unlock new weapons or bike upgrades is great concept\, as is the customisable bike\, which offers way more upgradable features than Arthur Morgan's horse!  Love the extensive main and side missions\, peppered with lots of \""freakers\"" (infected zombie-like humans)\, \""marauders\"" (bandits)\, \""rippers\"" (scary baddies) and animals (infected ones are frickin scary!) to combat.  The emphasis on stealth killing is refreshing too\, but the greatest and most novel feature is the freaker \""hoardes\"".  Unlike The Last Of Us\, where zombies are single or in little groups\, the Days Gone hoardes are frickin terrifying\, and I defy even the most seasoned of gamers not to sheet themselves the first time they are chased by one!  Talk about running around in state of perpetual panic whilst grappling with my sweaty PS4 joycon!  We are talking groups of up to 500 freakers\, yes\, 500!  Building up your weapons arsenal\, plus required upgrades\, alongside a wide array of bombs and other booty\, all leads up to taking on these monstrous legions of infected\, 40 hoardes in all.  Strategising each hoarde fight\, mapping your route using your environment to best effect\, is very satisfying.  The system of upgrading your Melee\, Range and Survival skills\, using Skill Points\, sustains interest and rewards progression\, as does upgrading Deek himself\, with Stamina\, Health and Focus.  The \""open world\"" map has fair amount of collectibles and historic landmarks to seek out\, but not overkill like Assassins Creed\, and killing animals for meat and harvesting floral for camp \""credits\"" or ammo crafting\, all add to the gameplay.   My main gripe with the game\, and I'm still midway through\, is the interactions and warfare with other humans.  They are so easy to kill\, no challenge at all\, certainly compared to the various types of freakers (\""breakers\"" are super strength infected which are scary as hell and hence harder to kill).  The humans are also thick as sheet\, they have no intelligence (e.g. you can kill one as it comes round a corner\, yet two of his mates will follow in quick succession) and learn nothing from their environment or your actions.  They seem to stand still or typically reload their weapons whilst you bludgeon them with a baseball bat\, hence rendering side missions to kill marauder or ripper camps no real challenge at all\, but Hell\, still kinda fun wiping them out\, just don't expect responsive AI.  Anyhoo\, in conclusion\, I'm enjoying Days Gone\, and genuinely interested to learn what happens to Deek and his bestie Boozer (the latter is ripe for DLC content; likeable buddy who happens to be bad ass).  And forget the stories of glitch galore; most have been patched and I've had none thus far.  So get your best weps and go kill some freaker butt\, :)… Expand",True,0.6844498515129089,0.7963948845863342,0.47075268626213074,0.7495311498641968,0.8694640398025513,0.8228140473365784,0.3594290018081665,0.7646533846855164,0.7090651392936707

The game could easily have concluded just before going to the southern section of theThey tried so very hard with this game and came so very close to making something brilliant. The thing about Days Gone isn’t that there is a major issue holding it back\, but that there is a plethora of minor flaws that plagued my experience when I played it.Firstly\, Days Gone is just far too long. The game could easily have concluded just before going to the southern section of the map. At this point the story became too convoluted and over-developed. We were searching for Sarah\, not some kind of Cold War. The length of the game also exposes the repetitive nature of many missions\, which boil down to fetch quests\, assassinations and arsons. Had I not been about 2/3 through the game before I noticed this\, I would have quit playing.Some of the other issues range from fragile weapons\, tedious motorcycle maintenance and the many bugs and odd collision detections. The process of increasing your health\, stamina and focus I found particularly arduous and also unnecessary on lower difficulties. These were little niggles that added up throughout the game.One other substantial issue I had was with the hordes. This game was marketed partly on the ability to take on massive hordes of the infected\, however this does not become engrained in the story until quite late\, including the tools needed to tackle a horde. In addition to this\, in-game tutorials are non-existent on taking down hordes. Videos online show skilled players methodically taking them down\, whilst I found it a protracted and chaotic mess that was far from enjoyable.So\, what does the game do well? The exploration is great once you have the motorcycle upgraded enough. At first the bike handled like jelly but eventually I got the hang of it and found it fun.The combat can be very satisfying\, particularly the explosives\, however I would have appreciated easier access these and the resources required to craft them. Shotguns in particular give a satisfying splat.The story is also quite good for the first half. I loved the elements of grief. However once Deacon resolves this the story explodes into a civil war narrative involving too few characters I care about. The second half of the game could probably have been kept for DLC or a sequel.Overall\, Days Gone is a rather bland and a run-of-the-mill zombie survival game that struggles to find its place amongst its contemporaries. Far Cry had better driving and vehicles\, The Last of Us did storytelling better and Dying Light did combat and exploration better. Some of these games notably were made years before Days Gone. There isn’t a lot left that Days Gone could innovate and it fails supersede what already exists.Despite this\, I still found Days Gone oddly compelling. If you are really thirst for another zombie game\, it could be for you\, otherwise go for a better title or wait for a sale.… Expand",True,0.38631919026374817,0.23677153885364532,0.09718136489391327,0.588762640953064,0.5823546051979065,0.17745265364646912,0.12080816924571991,0.5531644225120544,0.36598873138427734

Looking out on the vast landscape of the Oregon woods with the snow falling down all around me and hearing the eerie music and soundscape of the world of this game\, you could seriously not tell this was a debut AAA game from Bend.The story follows Deacon St John (played by the excellent Sam Witwer) looking for clues relating to his beloved wife\, all while trying to survive the harsh world around him and protecting all those close to him. The story was a surprising positive as I walked into Days Gone expecting a mediocre tale\, to be welcomed by a lavish multi threaded story of the highest calibre\, supported by excellent voice acting and mo-cap work by the team which makes everything feel real.I have seen a lot of reviews comment on the repetitive nature of the missions and whilst I can say there were not as much of a variety as I would have liked\, they were a solid selection and no different from titles such as Spider Man with a core number of activities you do whilst working through the 30-40 hour story. I have enjoyed every mission of the game so far in the almost 10 hours I have played with the story and game-play mechanics keeping me engorged with the world of Days Gone.During the game you will clear out camps and Freaker nests as-well as other mission types intertwined with story missions with set pieces and a more narrative direction as well as side quests. This is a game anyone can pick up and enjoy\, with good enough gun controls and a decent handling of Deacon's trusty bike.The Freaker hordes although not being featured as much as I would have expected are a worthy inclusion and a technical marvel by John Garvin and his team of wonderful designers. I have never felt so tense when having a horde ranging from 150-500 in size all screaming and chasing me\, with little ammo and having to use the world around me to pick them off.Days Gone makes you creative and get to grips with not just going in guns blazing every encounter\, you will want to use stealth to your advantage as well as melee weapons and throwables to help you out when under pressure from enemy attacks.You can tell this game was made with passion from everyone involved and I hope the harsh critics reviews do not deter Bend from making more wonderful titles as they can only go up from here.

It does a ton of flashback cutscenes that fade in and out very awkwardly as though there was supposed to be gameplay moments in-between\, I think that the opening of the game should have been these cinematics\, mixed with gameplay introducing you to stealth when getting behind the man with the gun (who is panicked and thinks you killed HIS wife)\, moving through the burning streets protecting your wife from rioters and early-freakers. Then transition into the opening bike driving act\, then you would have been up to speed with on-foot mechanics simultaneously. while establishing a bigger bond with your wife.Also a tiny nitpick. not much of a con at all\, doesn't affect the score: But I would have loved if Deacon had like a mixtape playlist that you can listen to while driving around similar to Star-Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy but Rock Biker music from the days before the apocalypse\, with great licensed music.

The gamesThe game isn't revolutionary by and means but sure as hell isn't as bad as a lot of people say\, Days Gone is an above average game\, definitely deserving of a high score\, around a high 7 or even an 8\, apart from some animation bugs the game is relatively glitch free but I can forgive the few there are given this is Bend Studios first outing on a home console in a very long time. The games main character Deacon is a very interesting person struggling with very human problems\, his mental state is clearly deteriorated after 700+ of a freaker hell with only his friend Boozman -who I will be referring to as that from this point onward- to keep his sanity stable... For the most part. The gameplay is fine\, nothing to write home about\, but far from bad\, the bike controls wonderfully\, it feels very weighty and even though I've never ridden a motorcycle I'd assume that's how they feel\, Deacon himself feels pretty regular\, par for the course in 3rd person action games like these\, he doesn't feel stiff or too loose and you can control him nicely to slip past enemies. I think the game mainly suffers from a lack of mission diversity\, it boils down to very safe formula\, go here do this\, find this\, kill these people\, it can hinder any longer play sessions and I often found myself switching to another game after a few hours\, especially with the Freaker Nests and Enemy Camps\, which can feel like a chore\, luckily the writing keeps it interesting for the most part\, even when riding between point A and point B\, you'll often get a little radio alert from Cope\, one of the settlement leaders\, and Deacons reaction is always entertaining. Is Days Gone good? Certainly\, do I think the game is amazing? No\, do I put on line with some of the ps4 exclusives? Not really\, God of War (overrated as it is) and Spider-Man are leagues ahead of Days Gone\, but I'd like to think of that as a testament to how good they are\, not one of Days Gone's shortcomings\, overall the game is great and remains one of my favourite of the year so far\, if you don't like 3rd person action titles\, this game isn't going to change your mind\, if you don't like zombies you probably won't like this\, but if you're like me and you can't wait for the zombie outbreak\, you'll probably have a lot of fun in Days Gone\, luckily the small survival elements don't get needy and whiney like...

The story was good with Deek and Boozer searching the apocalyptic world looking for Sarah. The bike mechanics was very fun and I liked constantly checking for my fuel status which made you think strategically when driving around Oregon. However after 20 hours or so I felt like it got stale. The missions wasn't different and the layout on how the missions work was quite confusing. My biggest issue is Days Gone should have finished 20 hours before it actually did. When O'Brien finally helps you find Sarah you unlock a new part of the map. This bit should have been DLC. At this point you would already be in 30-40+ hours and now you've got another 20 to become apart of this regiment. You can't revisit the rest of the map until you get to the last 4 missions of the game. Once you finally get to the last mission and ready to take on Sargent Garrett (very predictable) and you don't even get to kill him\, Sarah poisons his tea\, very bad ending.

You can just watch and wait out the mess or you can interact\, influence these random events\, you can even create these kinds of situations by siccing the freaks or animals on the camps for example (also during the storyline missions).Hordes are great.

Speaking about the atmosphere... As in any zombie/post-apocalyptic story\, all that zombie stuff is only the circumstance\, the context\, while the most important thing is how people survive it\, how they live\, interact\, try to build communities\, and of course\, how the new world changes them. When you play \""Days Gone\""\, you can really feel it\, just like when you read\, for instance\, \""The Walking Dead\"" comics. The characters are written well so you believe them. The character development is also a game's strong suit.The big thing is that you don't play as a savior\, a chosen one. You play as a normal guy who doesn't want to save the world\, who just want to survive and solve his own problems and help his close ones. This is what helps you to believe the story.The scenery of post-apocalyptic Oregon is just marvelous. Well-made dynamic weather\, which really affects the gameplay: your visibility depends on the weather (rain\, snow\, fog)\, so does the driving (by the way\, the driving itself is quite enjoying).The soundtrack is a masterpiece.Considering some disadvantages of the game\, I'd rate it a 9\, it really deserves more than all that hate and unprofessional reviews by the \""game journalists\"".\""This is Radio Free Oregon.

91017,DG,2020-06-20,10.0,"This is a full review\, but I’ll admit I should probably give it a 9/10 because while it is my favorite game\, it has its flaws. My only problems are with the guns and a couple points in the story. Guns need more balancing\, everybody uses the same load out because the Thompson\, TMP\, and RPD are so much better for hordes and human enemies. My problem with the story is that there are a few generic plot points. For instance\, when Sarah is actually alive\, or when Boozer also lives. I would’ve liked those points changed slightly. Also\, the NERO stealth missions get repetitive\, as their pathing will cause you to use the same routes. On to the positives. The environment of Days Gone is my dream environment\, it is so beautiful and well made. I actually want to go to Oregon now. Perhaps the best part of Days Gone\, the characters. On the surface\, they seem pretty plain. As you play the game  however\, they become more and more complex. You come to realize that Deacon for instance isn’t some hardened jagweed that always does everything for his own benefit and is fine with killing people all the time. He actually has some PTSD which is most likely realistic to someone that has been through what he has. The characters are also willing to do anything for the people they care about\, rather than being selfish dinks all the time. There are actually several moments that they serve as good role models. The gameplay is also great\, for me\, it’s exactly what I want in a game. The gun play is sloppy at the beginning but gets better over time\, and I love that. I also love that the entire game gets better and better over time. Literally everything about gets better. It’s a rarity. The ai is also really great. The human ai is pretty average\, nothing new except for some of the Ripper moments (the Rippers are a cult that won’t attack freakers\, it allows for some really fun ways to take them down). The freaker ai is where it’s at. They trip and fall trying to get to you\, and they sometimes attack each other as well. Stealth as usual for most games is average\, but can be fun. As I said before\, the NERO stealth will get repetitive. Finally\, the soundtrack and sound design. The sound design is amazing. Imagine it’s dark out in the mountains and raining\, you are walking\, and you hear a motorcycle in the distance\, you can’t quite tell where it is because the sound echoes in the mountains. Then you hear a bunch of faint growls and screeches. Then you see the motorcycles pass a few hundred yards in front of you\, followed by a horde. Yeah\, that’s exactly what can happen\, and because of the insane sound design\, it feels too real. The soundtrack is by far my favorite game soundtrack. It definitely deserves more attention\, and the main theme by Nathan Whitehead conveys a feeling of immense hope\, nostalgia\, and despair at the same time. A fantastic game that I 100% recommend.… Expand",True,0.8265088796615601,0.47260719537734985,0.39438214898109436,0.8202630877494812,0.8078304529190063,0.8193060755729675,0.716117262840271,0.7172553539276123,0.9131645560264587

Sam Witwer does an amazing job in bringing Deacon St. John to life. He is a very interesting character\, with a lot to tell. He does not reveal his emotions easily throughout the game\, as he is a closed person\, and this makes those emotional moments more intense than in other games\, where you know the main character almost like a friend since the beggining.Story-wise\, the game does well. It has a linear story\, with good characters and a good plotline. The antagonists are very interesting\, and the secondary characters you encounter\, which can go from important characters to the simple mechanic that sells you bike parts\, have stories of their own\, which you can build up each time you interact with them.The gameplay is fine. The bike and it's mechanics are a new addition which I wouldn't change. The shooting\, at the beggining is a bit strange (because of the reticle)\, however\, it does not take long to get used to. The horde system is AMAZING\, it takes a lot of inspiration from World War Z (the movie) and it is pretty fun to engage them\, and it is also scary to go near them. The world is very detailed and also very big\, with a variety of wild animals\, creatures and groups of people to see. A thing that I like about it\, is that it indtroduces the map piece by piece as you progress through the story\, just when you reach the end you can admire the size of the map. It is not on the level of Red Redemption 2's attention to detail or map size\, but in my opinion\, it has more than the majority of games.}I have really enjoyed this game\, I have played around 30 hours\, and I am sad that I am coming to the end of the story\, however\, the remaining side missions will surely keep me occupied as they are not few (yes\, after you finish the game you can still keep playing). The thing that I loved the most about it\, is Deacon St. John. In my opinion\, he is one of the most realistic and well written characters that I have ever played with.It is a shame that the critics have rated this game so low\, when the user score clearly tell otherwise.

Well..-It has a long story. To be honest once i thought the game was over after hours of play i was just half done.- Your motorbike is your best companion. You must always have it handy at all times. You bike consumes gas and brakes down little by little. You find gas scattered over your routes and you are best of to remember where the cans can be found at all times. Running out of fuel pretty much sucks but that rarely happens. You fix your bike by scavenging scraps salvaged from car wrecks etc.There are quite few weapons to get a hold of too\, from handguns\, submachine guns\, heavy guns and sniper rifles. They all fire differently and grenades\, pipe-bombs and other stuff can be crafted or bought\, mind you\, you only learn to craft them during your progress. Before that\, they are mostly found around.You also have melee weapons in various forms and shapes. And you soon learn that it will be your best weapon in close combat. These brake down by use Dead Island style. Once you learn the ability to fix them on the go to keep them healthy\, you best keep on doing that once you find a heavy-stat melee weapon you love. Once its broken\, its gone\, and you have to tend to your old boot knife for close combat when it happens until you find a new one.Zombies (or freaks as they are called here) comes in various forms. All from toddler freaks (Newts) that are skittish and territorial\, to regular runners and such. And more powerful once comes to play as you progress (not spoiling what they are) .If you caught the demo a while back featuring Deacon fighting a storm of zombies chasing him\, they are very well presented here. Around 40 hordes are out there for the challenge to wipe out ranging from 100 to 400 freaks in a group chasing you. A daunting time consuming task of planning your strategy to take them down. And it is these hordes that gives Days Gone the original take of the genre. It frightening fun to take them on. These hordes are to be avoided and fled from at all cost until you have higher stats and tougher weapons to take them on.You spend your times gaining reputation and money from a few various camps to buy weapons and gears for your bike. Although there are fast travel points\, i found out that riding around from A to B is much needed to scavenge parts\, ammo and other stuff that you need.The map is very well designed\, and i find it wonderful to explore. There are roads going to many hidden directions\, and there are hundreds of old cabins\, caves and camps riddled with loot for you to grab. Exploring the lands will satisfy you and consume much of your time.So what about the negative stuff.The controls are not the best i have encountered. Riding the bike is very tough in the beginning. It takes some time to get accustomed to it. Granted they tried the best to make it as realistic as possible.Gun fights takes some skills to master as well. Even with auto aim on\, there are many bullets spent without hitting anything.Maintaining your bike is a chore and breaks the gameplay flow quite a bit. Starting on lowest upgrades\, your bike consumes abnormally high amount of fuel and you refuel so very often. But once you have upgraded the tank a couple of times along with durability of your ride\, you find yourself less concerned about it luckily.Next\, The game is RIDDLED with bugs. Bethesda must applaud the devs of how many there is. bugs with landscapes disappearing \, controls\, malfunctioning. even game breaking bugs can occur. all is in there sadly. For a game with such a long time developments\, i am quite shocked it has so much errors in it.As many has said\, this game is OK for what it is. Dont expect a technical marvel. But great by itself for killing hours. I was quite taken on by the story and the character development is very good.A decent game\, but with some technical difficulties.… Expand",True,0.595641016960144,0.6406834721565247,0.4894198775291443,0.5829634666442871,0.6370766758918762,0.5003945231437683,0.15688037872314453,0.5926349759101868,0.13377174735069275

It sure does have a generous ammount of cheese\, don't get me wrong\, but the good far outshines the bad and in the end it stuck with me more than I expected it to. My biggest gripes with the game are the lack of polish\, which is imo inexcusable for a AAA title of this caliber\, it's pacing issues (especially when the middle part doesn't present any problems of this kind)\,  it being too long for it's own good\, and the way the gameplay feels. The side content is ubisoft like\, but surpisingly never gets monotonous thanks to the progression I've just praised above and  the number of different activities offered  to the player at any time.

If I tried\, it told me I was leaving the mission area\, then started me right back where I was trying to leave from. I just ended up just restarting at a much older (saved game point) and had to do many things all over again.- The game play\, is somewhat broke. My motorcycle crashed and fell into a river at the same time. I needed to repair the motorcycle before I could use it again\, but the game wouldn't let me repair it because you're not allowed to repair a motorcycle that is in water. Wait\, what? Well\, what am I supposed to do then? I crashed and my bike happened to be in the water\, the game tells me to repair it to continue\, then the games tells me I can't repair it. But the game also wont let me sit on the bike to move it and for some unknown reason the most basic aspect of owning a bike (pushing it) you aren't able to do in this game. Why?- Go to the area\, reach certain point\, thing happens\, cannot progress or move forward until after thing is completed.- The game forces certain events to take place\, even though many (most in fact) are completely avoidable in real life. There was a situation where I needed to escape an area. There was a rock no higher than a car that if it were in real life\, I would simply climb over the car sized rock and be out of the camp area. But this game forced me to go through about 20 minutes of nonsensical (kill the bad guy\, progress forward) rather than hopping over the rock.- Also\, what is with the (Community Trust) earnings? Can someone explain to me how I can go into a cave full of zombies\, then save an entire community multiple times while everyone else stands around behind the gates\, run errands\, save multiple people and kill countless bad guys and zombies\, but my trust still not be at the max level?The game is broke and or down right nonsensical. Forced interactions\, forced rail shooter like game play\, little freedom of movement after forced scenarios and situations occur\, horrendous game save issues\, trust apparently cannot be earned in the game even if you save entire communities\, you cannot push your bike.

The motion captured cutscenes are incredibly life-like\, with excellent facial animations and textures and character mannerisms. It really pulls you into the scenes. Environments look jaw dropping\, especially with weather effects like rain\, snow\, mist and fog. The muddy ground rivals Uncharted 4's! However\, there are some pop-in textures\, so sometimes characters and environments look bland before the textures start loading up. Can't wait for next gen to clear all these texture limitations and up the framerate.2. Excellent voice acting in general. Deacon is not your typical hero. There are times when I like him\, and times when I just can't stand the way he talks and acts. He's very flawed and almost unlikeable but in the end\, he grew on me. Seeing his relationships and interactions with other main NPCs help build the bond between you the player and Deacon as you slowly get emotionally invested in his journey.3. Zombie hordes are terrifying. And I only played on normal! My blood really got pumping when taking down hordes. A very unique experience.4. Motorcycles upgrades are fun\, and the variety of weapons\, tools and skills at your disposal make character progression very satisfying.5. Satisfying gunplay. My favorite weapon is the sniper rifle.  Sniping is oh so awesome. Challenge yourself by not tagging enemies and just rely on your situational awareness. I always go stealth and when things go awry\, I take the action up close. Very fun combat gameplay loop.6. Engaging story that got me interested to stick to the end.7. Interesting collectibles and historical facts of Oregon.8. Open world is not as intimidatingly huge as Ubisoft's AC Origins/Odyssey and Wildlands. It feels just right\, like Horizon Zero Dawn\, Death Stranding and MGSV.Cons:1. My main gripe is it's story. I love a big\, meaty single player game like The Witcher 1-3\, Skyrim\, Fallout\, God of War\, etc but by the end I was like\, when is this gonna end?? That's a sign of a poorly paced game in my opinion. They could have cut some parts of the game to make it more on point and I believe they will because I am overall impressed by Bend Studio and cannot wait for Days Gone 2.2. Storylines and Collectibles UI. When you progress through the story or find a collectible\, there is no shortcut or highlighted icon to the updated lore. You have to manually dig through the growing list of collectibles and quest log find the information you need. Devs\, just follow games like Dragon Age\, Witcher\, Mass Effect when it comes to codex and lore systems.3. Deacon. I can't stand the way he talks sometimes. Like he's unable to form a coherent sentence in his head. Not sure if it's the actor or direction they were going for. The 'umms'\, 'uhhhhs'\, awkward short pauses between words really made it frustrating for me. Boozer was much more fun to watch.4. Motorcycle dialog. Deacon screams to his NPCs when on the bike while the other person will be talking in a normal tone. Needs polishing.Overall\, I really enjoyed Days Gone and am excited to see how Bend Studio builds and improves in this new IP.

My heart is heavy because it's over and I can't carry on following the adventures of Deacon St John - the only other time I've had that was at the end of The Last Of Us\, and while I didn't cry this time around I'm still wandering around my apartment aimlessly\, desperately trying to find something to occupy my mind.I was hooked for the whole 80 hours I plugged in to the game and I can't recommend it enough. It takes a while to get going but after a little bit you won't be able to put it down. It's impeccably designed and written. A truly impeccable feat of game design.That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws. A lot of the quests are variants on \""go here kill/fetch this\"" but I always felt obliged to complete every single one. The characters were so engaging and the impact I was having on the world so great that every time the radio beeped I would jimmy on over to wherever I was needed. The flavour added by Cope's radio broadcasts and the little conversations you have over the radio added so much to the world. I genuinely enjoyed just riding around on my bike waiting for Boozer's next call or for Ricki to get in touch.My only criticism is that the difficulty curve slips and slides around. Play it on hard\, you'll thank me for that. While it's difficult at the start it will ensure that the game is always challenging enough that if you're stupid you'll die but still enjoyable enough that you won't give up playing it.Thank you Deek for a great adventure and thank you Sony Bend for making this game.

The game was a solid 7 at launch and between a 7.5 to an 8 at most post patch updates. And while an 8 may be generous in most people's eyes\, I can't help but applaud the ambition of Bend Studios to give yet another spin on the \""zombie (not zombie)\"" Apocalypse while telling a story about an \""any man\"" trying to survive in a post \""End of Days (hence Days Gone)\"" world. There were times when I was impressed\, even blown away by the ever changing weather patterns and shear number of bodies flooding towards me as I ran for a horde. Contrary to the common perception\, most people criticize the gun play and driving in this game\, but there's two caveats to this. One\, there's a learning curve and \""quality\"" curve that go along with using weapons in this game. And second\, most of the reviews posted here and elsewhere are from people that never even made it half way through this game. Let me give you some numbers:Out of copies sold PSN records the following achievement wise:24% have actually finished the story/completed the game on any mode.26% have gained allied status (rank 3) with any encampment in the game (possible with 50% of the game completed)36.8% have reached Crater Lake (roughly 75% story completion)42.8% unlocked 15 skills (or otherwise hit level 15)73.5% unlocked the \""Special Delivery\"" achievement (unlockable in the first 10 hours of the game depending on how well you're doing)So that means:- roughly 1/4 of the reviews/opinions have been made based upon 10 hours of gameplay (good or bad)- More than half the reviews were made by people that never unlocked less than 15 skills in the skill tree.- a whopping 3/4 of the reviews were made by people that never reached 75% completion of the story line.- and that same 3/4 of the reviews never even completed the game as of today!As a person that's completed the game and am currently sitting at 82% completion for achievements\, I've spent my time examining every nook and cranny of this title. Fortunately there are elements of truth that can be pulled from fanboys and critics alike. And let me tell you\, the final side of my review will be critical of the game.The coding of this game is flawed. Even after all the patches (as of this writing we are on version 1.11) there are still dips in frame rates when it comes to hordes and long durations of gameplay. Further\, there are times were the game has literally \""broke\"" on me and I couldn't attach a suppressor\, craft arrows or pick up items. Luckily the autosave kicks in very often\, but that doesn't help when you're in a \""story scenario\"" and must restart from the beginning due to a bug.The story is also severely flawed. I'll openly admit\, if I didn't want to see this game through to it's conclusion\, the story would have put me off where most people gave up or quit. Most of the characters are unlikable\, the character you play as is unrelatable and indecisive. The story tries to sell you on a huge narrative of a biker trying to find his wife yet it feels so shallow in empty. The characters never make rational decisions on screen which telegraph any tension they try building.  And perhaps the most egregious thing about the story is a side character who magically goes from heterosexual to homosexual in like a matter of weeks(?). Was this put in purely as fan service? If you examine the dialog between people\, this person is actually coerced into thinking it's \""right\"" but she never shows indicates that she believes it's who (or what) she actually is. As for the rest\, it felt like huge parts of the story were trimmed or completely scrapped. The story makes fantastical jumps at times. John Garvin\, writer and director of this game\, along with Anne Toole which did \""additional writing\"" should be ashamed. How can you successfully make every single character unlikable and expect the player to become invested in the story? I'd like to know how the pre-production meetings went during script revisions. Leilani Ramirez was in charge of dialog and again\, I'd like to know if John Garvin told her to explicitly direct every voice actor to sound annoyed\, ticked off and agitated during their line reads. The quality was just awful.The story leaves plenty of room for a sequel\, DLC expansions\, etc.though with the gaming community largely giving it an average at best rating\, only time will tell. I can say this though in closing. Had they been given another month to polish the game up (like what they've done through today's 1.11 version) they'd likely score higher. Let's just hope they have a different writer and director if a sequel does happen.… Expand",True,0.7535943984985352,0.8226030468940735,0.5924538373947144,0.750703752040863,0.795451819896698,0.7066102623939514,0.20460473001003265,0.7568724751472473,0.6443355083465576

That too if you can ignore the bugs\, crashes\, freezes\, bad enemy A.I. and have a lot of tolerance for repetitive content.The story is very predictable. Anyone who is over 14 and has seen a bunch of movies\, TV shows and played a decent number of video games would be able to predict the plot. It's just very plain and generic\, the characters are all stereotypes - you got a coward/weasal type character who will betray you and you will be able to tell from the beginning but they prolong it for so long like they are building up to something big but it plays out exactly like the way you would expect. Then you got a possible \""love interest\""\, some crazy guy who runs a \""cult\""\, a Colonel\, and so on. I didn't particularly dislike any character. They were just mostly uninteresting or their stories were predictable.Game crashed within the first few hours. Weapons would fly in the air and stay there. There is bad lip-syncing in some of the scenes\, glitches in subtitles. Many of these things have not been fixed even with the latest 30 GB+ updates as of December\, 2019.The game's story is also not told very well. There is very little information given to us about the world of Days Gone\, what led to it being the way it is\, how it happened and how it all spread. The game even just starts abruptly with no explanation. It's like someone had made a lengthy opening sequence at first but they ran out of space so they cut 70% of the part out and left it there. Most of the backstory of the world is told to us during those eavesdropping missions of O Brien where you have to stay in close range of some NERO scientists doing research. You have to play these type of missions many times and this is the biggest problem with this game - repetition.It has an insane amount of repetition. The story drags on for so long\, forcing you to do pointless repeat missions over and over again. They could have finished the game in half its length because more than 50% of this game's main story missions alone are pointless filler to make it 60 hour game. That's not including all the bunch of side missions which are all the same. As in many open world games\, you start out in a limited region with a few camps and you do missions for those camps. As you continue playing the game\, you unlock new regions with more camps. Now\, some of these new locations you unlock are actually very nice to look at. The presentation of this game is actually good. It felt like an open world version of The Last of Us many times. Imagine if the Bill's Town section of TLOU was fully explorable with a bike\, that's kinda what it's like and the indoor areas are also well done. But the problem is that these new regions has you doing the EXACT SAME THINGS as the other regions. Just more camps are unlocked and they all force you to do the same boring\, go here\, kill that guy type missions. Someone has betrayed the camp or stolen some supplies or murdered other camp members and you have to go kill him and return proof of kill to the camp leader for a reward. It's just inane pointless excuse for filler content. None of the areas where these missions take place even have any variety in them.Now\, there are some things I did enjoy fully like fighting huge hordes of zombies and the realistic snowfall. It's I believe the first time we have had something like this in a game (at least on consoles). Snow that falls and accumulates on the environment. You could see the snow falling on grass\, roads\, buildings\, cars and even dead bodies\, slowly turning everything around you white. It honestly blew me awayBut there is so much to nitpick on this game like how does the camp credit system work? You kill one of the infected then Deacon grabs their ear as a \""bounty\"" and brings it to the camp in exchange for credits. What if you cut off two ears from one body and get double the profit? There's no way they would be able to tell anyway. Why are they paying him credits for that anyways? To keep their region clean of the infected? But how do they know that you killed the infected in that particular region and not from somewhere far far away?Other small nitpicks - No outfit customisation and disappointing bike customisation. The headlights on everyone's bike are always on. When you are riding with other characters then their headlights are on even in the day time. Sliding on snow has no effect.

91294,DG,2020-01-25,7.0,"I frankly don't think this game is underated\, reviewers and game journalists in general\, don't see with me that eye to eye\, but this is a game that I can agree with their opinion quite a lot.I'm not sure about the state of Days Gone at release\, all I know is that Days Gone isn't the marvelous game that a lot of people seemingly seem to think it is\, it has some incredible moments\, andI frankly don't think this game is underated\, reviewers and game journalists in general\, don't see with me that eye to eye\, but this is a game that I can agree with their opinion quite a lot.I'm not sure about the state of Days Gone at release\, all I know is that Days Gone isn't the marvelous game that a lot of people seemingly seem to think it is\, it has some incredible moments\, and others that are frankly quite mediocre\, but for the most part\, I would say that the game\, at the very least when taking into consideration its story\, doesn't work that well for the most part.The game is divided into three segments that involve generally speaking\, doing the same things over\, and over again\, you're supposed to complete missions\, and side missions\, to increase your relationship with multiple encaments throghout the game\, this is represented by a level and a meter that slowly increases as you complete missions\, rescue hostages\, or clear hordes (an activity that you can't really achieve up until the last couple of missions in the game).The biggest issue with Days Gone lies in artificial pandering\, this freaking game needed a f***ing  editor or something of the sort because frankly\, the first few dozens of hours of the game could be cut easily\, the first two encampents could've been removed from the story completely and you wouldn't be missing anything\, by comparison the second encampent (the one from Crystal lake for reference sake) is the one moment where the story peaks\, and I would say\, the main core moment where the story takes a turn for the better\, you meet friends\, antagonists\, there's a questioning on how the world is changing and affecting people's humanity around them\, admitedly there are some missions in this part of the game that don't make much sense\, some story arcs are completely forgotten after being introduced\, and some characters are introduced\, while others retired\, without making that much sense\, but generally speaking this is where the game really \""shines\"" to put it in a way.On the other hand the game has this story arc across the whole experience which is Deacon (the main protagonists) long lost love\, and his arduous journey in trying to encounter his wife\, it's enticing\, at first\, but then after a while it becomes redundant\, and frankly the presentation of Sarah (Deacon's wife) left a lot to be desired on my part\, their relationship seems to hinge in cliches\, and artificial interactions\, that made me not care in the least about this aspect of Deacon's life\, it wasn't until the end of the game when some of this actually made sense to me\, and made me care in a way\, the ending was a beautiful thing in my opinion\, closing a lot of story arcs in a good way\, albeit some in ridiculous over the top\, nonsensical\, idiotic ways\, but for the most part as the credits rolled and I glared at Deacon driving across all of the landscapes I've visisted before\, I felt a strange feeling of warmth inside of me.The voice acting also leaves a lot to be desired for the most part\, specially because of Deacon\, whenever Deacon gets angry\, and throws a strange scream\, or attempts at trying to be furious about something\, ends up being more funny than real\, just because of how over the top it is.The combat system and the gameplay for the most part are great\, but I always got the feeling that combat systems\, and the segments of interactivity in this game didn't last as long as they had to.I found myself in many\, many circumstances\, in which I would finish a camp in minutes\, while other times I would finish missions in seconds\, completing the objective\, and then heading back the way I came.The gameplay is a mix between simple stealth elements\, and gunfights\, you get multiple weapons throughout the game with the issue being that most of them are difficult to compare one with the other\, in order to try and figure out what are the best ones\, and what are the worse ones.All weapons in the game have stats\, and levels\, that are supposed to serve as a reference as to which ones are good\, and which ones are bad\, but none of those two things really factor in for the most part\, if anything is the other way around\, some of the stats straight out lie to you in telling you some weapons are betters than others.The gameplay is good however for two reasons\, there's a sense of unpredictability to both stealth and gunplay\, you get this feeling like you never will know the outcome of every encounter\, even if you're clearly winning.The other aspect is the brutality of the combat\, the guns feel devastating\, and powerful\, while the stealth elements are brutal and raw in their presentation for the most part.Generally speaking I would say I had a lot of fun playing this game\, I got in on a sale\, I do not regret my purchase\, but I also don't think is this marvelous experience everyone talks about.…

Oh\,I was fooled by all the positive reviews here\, this game is pretty bad. Note: playing at difficulty just one notch over normal. Difficulty level cannot be changed later in the game\, so you need to guess in advance what works for you.You play as an obnoxious character who despises almost everyone else\, and cannot help but scoff\, curse or use sarcasm every time someone says anything. Oh\, and he's a disgruntled vet who's seen too much death in his day\, talk about cliché.Since the world is full of zombies\, named freakers\, survivors tend to group in relatively safe camps. You reluctantly work for these camps hunting bandits\, reducing zombie infestation and the like.You move around on a bike whose tank grants about 1 km range (seriously!). Later on\, you can upgrade it to make things a little better\, but it's the first bad call. You can find fuel in gas stations\, fed checkpoints and some other locations\, so you need to plan your trips around the ludicrous fuel consumption.So\, you are happily riding towards your destination when you see a laser zeroing in on you? Too bad\, one second later your bike is shot out from under you and you'll need to use 7 scrap units\, out of a maximum of 10 you can carry\, to fix it. Since scrap can be found randomly in certain vehicles and is also used to craft crossbow bolts and fix your melee weapon\, this is another idiotic idea. Essentially: \""Too bad\, we are randomly taking out almost all of your resources\, sucks to be you\"".Then come the weapons. While enemies obviously have infinite ammo\, the first rifle I acquired could carry all of 15 shots in reserve. It takes 4 or 5 shots to kill a zombie\, so you do the math. You are forced to use headshots; a bullet time ability helps out to an extent\, but this is another case of pure genius that completely ruins combat for me. You can get a sniper rifle with 5+1 shots\, and again\, only a headshot will take out an enemy in one. You expect to find ammo on the bodies of fallen enemies? Think again\, not gonna happen unless you are using the exact same weapon as them (at least\, I think this is it because I can find pistol ammo but not rifle ammo). Auto rifles make things a lot better. Even though they have the same damage rating as semiautos\, they can carry three times as much ammunition or more\, which begs the question: why keep semiaoutos in the game at all\, then?Then it must be difficult to take out a camp full of bloodthirsty\, drugged enemies\, right? No\, it's a piece of cake due to their idiotic behaviour and the absurd stealth mechanics\, where magic bushes hide you like the shroud of invisibility\, I very rarely die in this situation. Random encounters\, on the other hand\, are deadly. I was about to kill the last man in an enemy camp when EIGHT wolves came out of nowhere\, and this is a very tough situation to survive. Fast melee enemies are infinitely more dangerous than poor shooters in this game\, and eight of them? Bad mojo. Same when three super hard\, super fast zombie wolves zero in on you\, which happens all the time. So\, what genius decided that random encounters should be much more of a challenge than all-out assaults?Hey\, at least you get good loot\, right? Nope. Don't expect to get anything when you kill someone. A zombie is worth a bounty of 5 credits\, while a mid level weapon will cost at least 2000-something. A human will never yield equipment you can sell\, so combat will never repay you of what you spend for ammo. This means you'll never buy ammo\, relying instead on rare police cars or ammo canisters to get it free. The \""no loot\"" approach is really bad\, it makes any extra fight on the road to a mission an annoyance\, rather than any fun.Weapon silencers only last for a few shots and you cannot carry replacements (it figures). So\, when you open a car and find a rare oil filter\, which is what silencers are made of in this game\, can you discard a half-used one and get the new one instead? Of course not! You'd need to use it up by firing\, therefore wasting precious ammo.By the way\, you cannot buy good weapons at the beginning. These only become available when a camp trusts you\, which takes a lot of missions to accomplish. A zombie yields maybe 3 trust points; to go from lvl 2 to 3\, you need 25000\, and each camp has its own rating.There are stealth sequences in which you must shadow scientists from a fed organization\, to listen in on them. Do you remember the universally panned shadowing sequences from the old Assassin's Creed games? Totally unfun\, but at least they are generally easy to complete.Then there are motorcycle chases\, where you need to chase a guy on a nearly indestructible bike\, while his minions chase you. Another unremarkable minigame.So\, the game has a little of Far Cry\, a little of [generic stealth game here]\, some driving action\, some poorly implemented crafting\, but it does nothing well.

It is your generic open world third person survival action shooter/survival game with a decent narrative. The unique thing about this game are the hordes of zombies that you have to fight. While they are a welcome addition\, it all boils downDays Gone is a decent game but it is not the greatest game you'll ever play. Does it do anything new that others games haven't done? Well\, no and yes. It is your generic open world third person survival action shooter/survival game with a decent narrative. The unique thing about this game are the hordes of zombies that you have to fight. While they are a welcome addition\, it all boils down to manipulating the AI of the zombies - they aren't very intelligent (but what can you expect from zombies?). You basically keep running until they decide to turn back to return to their original position at which point they are vulnerable and you can shoot them. The biggest problem that the game has isn't the game\, its that the game doesn't run as good. I played it on a base PS4 and the game lags extremely while riding a bike or facing a large horde.Now that I have given a short opinion about the game\, we'll discuss it in detail. The review will be divided into four sections: the game play\, the story\, the sound design and the graphical fidelity (plus performance) of the game.The Gameplay: Days Gone has great fundamental mechanics. It has good melee combat. The motorcycle has good controls. The stealth is passable. The survival elements add a bit more to the game but never felt too tedious.  The gun play is a bit lacking because of the recoil but it gets much better the more you upgrade it. Speaking of upgrades\, there is a decent progression system with actually useful skills that you can unlock - seeing enemy through walls\, making less sound\, carrying more items\, etc. The radial menu is good but sometimes i had to finagle my way through crafting some gear. For comparison to other games\, the game controls better than The Witcher 3 (TW3) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) BUT not as good as Spider-Man or Metal Gear Solid V. As good as it controls though\, the mission structure is basically the same - you keep clearing out zombie nests and bandit camps while progressing the story. The story missions\, however\, do have some better quality and variety to them. Overall\, the game play is fun but repetitive.The Story: I won't spoil any major parts of the story but I'll give you a feel of how it plays out. The world is divided into regions and you do runs for camps for credits and trust. The more the trust you have with a camp\, the better they treat you and allow you to get better gear for yourself and your bike. You want to ride North to leave everything behind and you need better gear - thus Deacon's story begins. Deacon is an interesting character to play as - he's no Geralt from TW3 or Arthur from RDR2 nor does he possess the range of these characters but his motivations keep the interesting to see it all pan out. There are no choices that you can make which heavily impact the story. There is a side narrative of how the zombies came to be which gets interesting the more it is revealed.Sound Design: It's just okay. The music is good during certain parts of the game but sometimes it feels as though the game is trying too hard. There is a certain scene where I had to roll my eyes because it tried so hard to copy other AAA games to the point where it was hilarious. However\, there came another scene with basically the same script but this time\, the music felt earned because of an important plot point that had occurred in the story. Another gripe I have with the sound design is Deacon himself. Although portrayed masterfully but he keeps on repeating lines even to the point where you have completed a quest but Deacon keeps telling himself that he needs to complete this quest - its hilarious.Graphics & Performance: The game looks great but runs bad. I played it on a base PS4 with HDR enabled. I had MAJOR frame rate problems with the game when driving a bike to the point where I had to take a break from the screen. It's egregious to the point that it exhausts you. Driving controls are good but not fun when you are constantly driving around in 12 frames per second. I hope they fix the frame rate issue because the game\, when it does run\, its a beauty to look at. The weather effects in this game rival the biggest games of this generation like RDR2. The snow doesn't just fall\, it accumulates around you. It changes how you play. It dampens your sound. Your bike slides in snow. It's really well done.Verdict: A good game with repetitive mission structure and bad performance. The developers are constantly rolling out patches though so I hope it improves in the future.… Expand",True,0.7811224460601807,0.9242902398109436,0.6813288331031799,0.8521277904510498,0.9187965989112854,0.6668693423271179,0.3113725483417511,0.8577935099601746,0.8915337920188904

91595,DG,2019-04-30,7.0,"This review contains some Spoilers!Even though i like the ps4 more than the xbox im still going to be completely neutral in this review of Bend Studios Days Gone.So im 25+ hours into the game and so far it is really fun when everything works but i've had some bugs in this game for example i played a mission where i was supposed to follow some guy and he just fell into the ground and i had to restart the mission which was really annoying. I also had some other bugs but aside from that this game can be really fun. Another bug i found was that a guy called me the same time the radio was on so i had two people talking at the same time which was annoying.The combat in this game is not brilliant. I don't feel like i have to buy any other guns and the ones i've used feels pretty much the same. The combat also feels a bit clunky with the third person camera but overall the combat is just okay to mediocre.Some things i liked about Days Gone were the trust system where you had to gain trust to be able to buy the higher tier guns and bike upgrades which is good so you have something to work for and the upgrades to the bike feels rewarding aswell and it makes you want to have a faster and quieter bike. The driving in this game is really fun aswell and it gets even better when you upgrade it. It also didn't get boring for me to drive the bike to all the different locations and i've almost never used fast travel which is a good thing. You also have to take care about your bike because it can break and run out of fuel. If it breaks you need to find scrap from broken cars or you can just find them out while looting and if your fuel runs out you need to find a gas at a gas station or just a can laying somewhere. This part of the game is good and later on you can also upgrade your bike to resist more damage and have a bigger tank.The sound of the bike is really good and also is the overall graphics in the game and the overall sound of the game is ok.This game also has a perk system where you can choose which type you want to upgrade. There are three types of perks: Melee\, Ranged and Survival. I personally found the ranged category the most useful because it made my guns better and more fun to use. Melee is also good. Have not upgraded too much on survival yet but im definetly going to.The main storyline at the beginning is to find Deacon's lost wife even though he didn't even knew she was alive. The story itself is pretty good with it's good and bad parts. There is also different storylines so it's not the same the whole time and if you complete a storyline you get some pretty cool awards. My favorite one is the \""I Remember\"" one where you find out about Deacons past in flashbacks which was really cool to see how he acted and how the world looked before the apocalypse. Some storylines is not that good though. I have to help people i don't feel anything and most characters you meet are not memorable which is a big issue in this game.So briefly said\, the game is fun to play and the best part of this game is the driving and the trust/upgrade system in the game. Story okay and combat mediocre but overall the game is still fun and it is very satisfying just killing freakers with melee attacks. Definetly worth checking out but if your not sure if your going to like it or not you should probably wait for a sale.Story - 6.5/10Combat - 5/10Gameplay - 7/10Sound - 7/10Graphics 8.5/10Fun 8/10Upgrading/Trust system 8.5/10So after that i give this game 7/10. Definetly not the best game on the ps4 but definetly not the worst. 7/10 is not bad. People just think that because its yellow it's not good but 7/10 for me is a good game.Overall fun game and is worth checking out!… Expand",True,0.9768502712249756,0.9769452214241028,0.685219943523407,0.9647979140281677,0.9369305968284607,0.811794638633728,0.8688845038414001,0.7825879454612732,0.9691277146339417

Let me tell you\, the first 10 hours are fun and the graphics are as good as you can expect\, but after 40 hours (the time it takes finishing the main quest)\, the issues become conspicuous. The main problem is the lack of spontaneity and imagination in the game's design. This open world that you can't fully travel until after the ending; there are a ton of loading screens\, invisible walls and artificial walls that stop you from being creative when tackling mission objectives and\, above all\, it lacks variety in terms of random events\, it recycles assets to a fault and the missions are textbook fetch quests. Deacon's abilities lack imagination and there's simply not enough variety in terms of weapons (not that you need it\, because of the very simplistic nature of the missions\, but anyway). The motorcycle gets much of the attention but not even Deacon cares about cosmetic customization and there's obviously no attachment with the motorcycle. You always face the same ambushes\, rescue the same NPC\, loot the same trunk; it gets boring. The horde\, on the other hand\, is great\, but it really gets attention after hour 25. And then come the technical problems. Maybe a few of these are solved by the time you read this\, but back when I played\, framerate was really bad and it was buggy as hell\, sometimes the minimap doesn't show the way\, some graphic signs won't disappear; voices tend to desynchronize; I had a motorcycle chase that bugged out and the guys I was chasing were stuck; and so on.

(State of Decay 2 was just a copy of SoD 1 IMO from what I've seen of streamers playing it\, never finished 1). I put the \""quality\"" in quotes here because initially\, this game did not seem to be \""quality\"" to me. The beginning of the story was disjointed\, I had no idea what the **** was going on\, etc. Tbh\, if they would have made the beginning of the game playable in any point\, that would have hooked me more.Like escorting Sarah to the chopper (during that first scene that was what I expected to happen\, I do really believe that that was cut from the game) or something to that effect\, to get people to care more about those characters from the outset. However\, that was not what happened\, thus\, it took me far longer to identify and have empathy for these characters.However\, I have now played about 35 hours of the game over the weekend and have about 800 days gone in the game (I don't know if this is an \""arbitrary number\"" or not to be honest) and I have to say\, after dealing with a lot of the events in the game\, I am so emotionally invested in the game. I'm trying to leave spoilers out\, but people can probably guess what happens to Boozer spoiler\, and the resulting story-line from that has made me actually CARE about saving Boozer (I highly doubt the game lets you skip story-lines to the point that Boozer would die or something\, but the game makes you feel like that'll happen if you don't get it taken care of).That's another thing is that upon my initial hour and a half foray into the game\, I did not care for Deacon and Boozer. Like\, I just did not care who these people were\, and why they were there\, how they got there\, etc\, due to the beginning of the game. That's not really how I wanted to phrase it\, but close enough. But now after almost 48 hours in the game\, I stop at every bandit camp and wipe them out to protect the roads\, I stop at every infestation to wipe them out to clean those damn Freakers from the Earth\, I like stopping in at camps for the feeling of \""I am safe here.\""\, I like hitting up the NERO centers/checkpoints and getting the stat boosts and a good night's sleep (basically the only \""sleeping area\"" I use during the game since I always hit them at night for some reason). I'm even hesitant to go out into the world now because\, to me\, I just want Deacon and Boozer to be safe and never enter the outside world again. But I know if I let that mindset take me\, I'm gonna drop the game\, and that is the farthest thing I want right now.This game has sunk its jaws into me and will not let go. It's made a lover of this game out of me\, even with all the issues it has at the moment (which is like... the one sound bug with the one Exhaust upgrade (Exhaust II does not have this bug\, got it last night and never ran into the sound bug with it)\, FPS issues\, and some issues with some areas/missions not completing\, seemingly randomly. So probably about 3-5 issues or so for most people)\, it's an excellent game and I wish a speedy patch recovery for the issues that are happening at the moment. And I don't say this lightly since it takes a lot to change my mind about a zombie game that I considered \""crap\"".I'm maybe hoping eventually they run some sort of \""community actions\"" like \""Kill 100 million zombies\"" or something across all players and we get some bike decals or something\, but even if they don't\, I could see myself running through this game again (even better if there's a NG+ mode or something).Begrudgingly\, 9/10 game\, would buy again. I'm at work right now and considering going home early just to play more of the game before I have to go to sleep lol.The only thing I wish is that Bend would take a look at the issues digital copies are having (major FPS loss/artifacting\, can't see the screen/environment/enemies) as this is affecting some of my friends' abilities to play the game.… Expand",True,0.5917220711708069,0.7151941657066345,0.5172332525253296,0.6822516918182373,0.6594163179397583,0.6280169486999512,0.1149745061993599,0.5746739506721497,0.41901907324790955

You play as a bland one-dimensional character Deacon St John a bounty hunter who stayed in the Oregon region to find answers about his past. The game starts off like a Mad Max Situation\, your bike is taken and stripped for parts\, so your objective is to build your bike from scratch and make it the best bike in all the land. I progressed through the game at quite a slow pace and upgrading my bike seem to be more of a chore then an enjoyment\, I feel this way because it seem to take a long time to build the trust up in the camps to get the parts I needed or wanted in this case. While I was not building up my bike\, I was out performing what seem to be very mindless tasks and exploring the very bland world of Days Gone.While its not all bad there is a lot of fun to be had when it comes to Days Gone\, infiltrating drifter camps and taken them down silently with my boot knife never got old or tiring. The gun gameplay is unique on its own but can be a bit aggravating when it comes to unlocking them\, just like the bike parts you must have a certain trust levels unlocked. Like The Last Of Us the melee combat is unique and very satisfying from crafting to brutal take downs with a piece of two by four with a saw blade in it; another thing that is like the last of us is the crafting system of collecting resources to craft things like Molotov cocktails and med kits.The story in days gone is certainly a unique one\, there is not really a certain one main story the closest thing that comes to it is trying to find out what happens to Deacons wife as you re live the past with their relationship and the events that transpired in it. But there are many story lines in the game\, none that are very captivating\, and it seems to take so long to complete these story lines an unnecessary amount of time.  In Reality while playing this game I felt like I was going from one mind numbing mission to the other because I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over; not to say they were not fun  but the fun came in spurts\, the game feels longer then it should have been.While you are not cruising around on your bike or going from mission to mission you are fighting off hordes off freaker’s.  When fighting off the hordes having focus shot is a must and having a automatic rifle\, extended clip and Molotov cocktails are vitals when it comes to focusing on this task and is a lot of fun.Days Gone suffers from performance issues\, the open world is very bland it would have done better as a linear game\, and falls short when it comes to the fun factor.

91681,DG,2019-07-30,8.0,"8.5 FOR ME! Just done playing this game on HARD mode and now I moved on to Survival mode. Its a blast! I will go over a few things below:PACING - I don't see why people found issues with this? At first I was feeling overwhelmed by the amount of content\, side-missions and basics of every new region that unlocks. But thanks to the 'slow' start\, I understood so much about the game right at the start that was very helpful in learning how the game functions. It gives a base understanding of the mechanics such as what you unlock from clearing ambush camps\, what you get by burning nests and what happens from activating NERO points. I never really had any issues with the pacing of the game. If you just want to beat it for the sake of it\, YES\, the game is slow but then its not even fun.STORY/PERFORMANCE - Overall\, the story is good. It gets better as the game goes on and it has some really unexpected plot twists which work out well. The secret ending(s) setup perfectly for the sequel and some speculations as well. I will say that the game lacked the performance or effort from certain characters and sometimes Deacon and a few others didnt sound/act natural or came out polished but overall I am satisfied. Nothing great in performance but nothing average either.GAMEPLAY - Ok\, first of\, you don't get to fight the hordes right off the bat and that sucks. I hope that in the next game\, they at least give you a back seat at horde fights; watching a bunch of people from each camp/region take out a horde in unity so it feels like this can't be done alone\, only to do the hordes alone at later stages of the game. Being an open-world game\, I really found it interesting and strategic as to how I should deal with certain situations. Customizing and Flexibility was well placed here. You can take out enemies in a handful of different ways and those ways can then be done with different weapons. The game allows you to Fast Travel between major checkpoints (except survival mode) which is a plus as you may not be the one who likes to ride your bike that much. The time of the day and weather impacts are very creative of the studio and I am hoping that they expand upon it in the next game\, not sure how but the studio is welcome to surprise us. I am not a huge fan of shooting games and don't know much about the mechanics so I will just say the shooting aspect seemed ok to me. The human AI\, however\, is extremely dumb in stealthy situations and I hope it gets fixed.TECHNICALITIES - Ok this is where the negatives are\, most of them. The game still drops frames (patch 1.30) towards the end part of it. And that becomes consistent. There are glitches and bugs in it. Are they game-breaking? Well I only encountered 2 or 3 being game-breaking. One where a tough enemy was stuck and I could cheese kill him by exploiting the glitch. Another where I couldn't access my inventory which stopped me from completing a mission. And maybe another here or there that wasn't that game-breaking but kind of vital. They can all be fixed by rebooting the game/console. If you don't play for more than 2-3 hours per sitting\, you won't really encounter most of these bugs. But still\, they are annoying at times and can make you rage.OVERALL - Overly satisfied with the game and can't wait for the sequel!… Expand",True,0.202856183052063,0.6077889800071716,0.37614762783050537,0.5900972485542297,0.44399455189704895,0.49526727199554443,0.21167495846748352,0.41120436787605286,0.2473403960466385

There is little motivation to keep going during the early hours\, and you feel a bit underpowered and overwhelmed. Days Gone feels a bit bloated at times and could have used some strong editing or some other way to draw you in sooner. It is true\, what you've heard\, that the game gets better the more you keep playing. The story really becomes one in which you meet interesting characters in varied locations\, and the protagonist\, Deacon St. John\, reveals layers of depth. This is a true hero's journey\, with an arc that will have you invested in his success. There are twists and turns along the way\, with reveals and surprises.Technically\, yes\, there are issues. The frame rate tends to drop when you're riding in the open world\, and that can become frustrating. I have also experienced several crashes where I had to restart the game. I have found that a full reboot of the console tends to clean out many of the issues\, but this shouldn't happen with a first party game. That being said\, Days Gone can be exquisitely gorgeous at times. The lighting compliments the detail put into this world\, and the cutscenes often have a nice polish to them. The animations of the hordes are a technical achievement that deserve praise. I have often found myself saving clips from my more terrifying encounters. It seems like Sony Bend was just shy of perfecting their vision for Days Gone\, and could have used a bit of help on the technical side\, but overall this is a very nice looking game.Sony Bend nailed the motorcycle. It handles as it should\, and considering its your primary mode of transportation\, investing in upgrades will offer satisfying payoffs resulting in better handling and speed (and gas milage). Don't be surprised if you find yourself personalizing your bike with tasteful decals or eye-catching colors. Your bike will be a reflection of you and your journey through Days Gone. It never gets old seeing your motorcycle in all its glory in the main menu.The combat is also quite satisfying. The melee weapons are crunchy and varied\, from a nail-spiked bat to hatchets and axes\, and even a saw-blade swinger that will do some serious damage. As far as the guns go\, there is a nice selection of assault riffles\, pistols\, sniper riffles and light machine guns\, as well as explosives and Moltovs. You can earn upgrades for your weapons and attach silencers to them for some much needed stealth. You continue to get better weapons as you move through the game\, and will be appropriately armed by the time you're facing down the hordes. Pro-tip: You will see hordes earlier in the game. Just run. You aren't ready yet. You will know when it is time to face them head on.The character performances are mostly admirable. Deacon can be a bit silly with his grunts and tantrums\, and you'll find his reactions are often over the top. But everyone else nails their characters\, and Deacon\, despite his melodrama\, is a character that you might grow to love. He's a ham\, but he's earnest\, loyal\, and dependable. He's a man who has lost everything\, searching for something\, anything\, to keep him from going over the edge.Days Gone is truly Sons of Anarchy meets The Walking Dead. It doesn't hit all its marks\, but its aim is true. It is unfortunate that Days Gone takes a bit too long to hit its stride\, but once it does it offers satisfying gameplay\, gorgeous vistas and compelling characters that will see you through to the end of its journey.… Expand",True,0.7083345651626587,0.46887537837028503,0.24169260263442993,0.8444923162460327,0.640570878982544,0.8086399435997009,0.2114398032426834,0.5147113800048828,0.13223326206207275

91771,DG,2019-06-05,6.0,"Very minor spoilersI don't understand all of the high user scores for this game. While this is not a bad game it isn't a good game either. There are numerous technical issues such as the motorcycle driving straight through road instead of on it. The fighting is nothing special. Most of the guns are useless\, or just unnecessary. Aiming is worthless until you get a through upgrades. Taking cover is also made into a difficult process. My least favorite thing about this game is how the money is split between camps. If you don't have money in the area with the motorcycle shop or the gunsmith it becomes almost useless\, I found myself fast traveling to unnecessary places just so I could by ammo or fill up my bike. The story is all right\, but is ruined by the most cliched **** ever in Skizzo who should really just be named \""Sketch\"". All the other characters are either complete ****s\, really stupid\, or a combination of both. Hordes are the bright spot of this game\, but even that is greatly diminished with a tiny stamina bar\, and in inability to get far enough away from hordes to hit them with a molotov without lighting yourself on fire. Then there is all the collecting of items just to make items like pipe bombs and super Molotovs can be a pain in the ass. You cannot buy crafting ingredients\, and you can't hold much until later upgrades. The bike has an incredibly small gas tank\, especially at the beginning you will be spending all your money on gas. Motorcycle fights are very boring and kinda annoying. There is an entire quest line dedicated to listening to N.E.R.O officers while hiding in bushes. Never get to far from your bike by the way\, because it is your fast travel. You need to constantly hop back on your bike to make sure you don't wander to far away from it.In conclusion\, I am not a hater like some of you people giving 10/10 are saying. I went into this game knowing nothing about it\, and hoping for a good time. By the time I finished I was incredibly frustrated with the game\, and especially the stupid ending. Nothing special ever happens in this game. The hordes are the brunt of the zombies\, most enemies are just other bikers. Poor shooting \,and melee weapons break very quickly. Everyone drives a bike literally everyone and they also all have a biking background somehow. I mean I guess bikers are better equipped to handle zombie apocalypse aka Daryl Dixon. This is not a 10/10 game anybody who says so must have a bias\, because the bugs alone should be enough to not down at least to a 9. I my opinion this is a mediocre game that is not worth a 60 plus dollar purchase.

Many of the characters are just not likable\, make poor choices and lack backstory overal. For example the person \""Jack\"" is apparantly an very important character for Deacon\, however we never see him at all in the entire story. Where do the rippers come from? Why are they cutting themselfs? How did the virus spread so far so fast? Why didn't the govermant do anything? I mean if deacon can kill 300 zombies on his bike\, shouldnt a tank be able to do alot more? Nothing makes sense. The main bad guy never tells his reasons for trying to murder other camps.The only thing that I do like in the game is the one horde battle which is shown in the trailer.

I enjoyed every second of this game till now and believe me I didn’t encounter any problems or glitches whatsoever\, no frame drops or audio sync issues without even updating it (Yes I played it with V1.00). The only problem in this  game is the awkward transition between cinematics and game play which might be a turn off point for some people\, but it didn’t bother me at all\, and maybe this issue is fixed with latest update which is 23.762GB in size. The game has amazing graphics and it is a Huge Game as I have included the full Map with this review. This game gathered elements from different other AAA games e.g. Graphics is on par with RDR2 + Days Gone has dead eye like feature to slow the time while shooting\, Days Gone is clearly inspired by Horizon Zero Dawn as majority of the time I felt like I was playing HZD to be honest (When you play Days Gone you will know why I felt that way) during my game play\, and of course Bend Studio also took some inspiration from Last Of Us (Days Gone Vibe and environment is similar to it). I can’t comment on story since I haven’t finished this game yet but I am definitely going for Platinum. Trust me “Bend Studio” were not kidding when they said “This World Comes For You’ + “Your bike is your major companion to survive in the harsh world of Days Gone” because Freaker hordes can seriously be overwhelming and in this scenario with limited resources the only way is to run on the bike from it\, also you will have to refuel and maintain your bike quite frequently in the early stage until you get good upgrades for it.Please don’t get offended but I hated Assassin’s Creed Origins because of the grinding if I could some up full Assassin’s Creed origins game in one sentence it would be something like this in a nutshell “ Hello Bayek some bandits/guards stole my thing/killed someone\, go to the outpost and get it back/kill the guy”. The reason why I included Assassin’s Creed Origins because many reviewers said that days gone is repetitive that is one of the reason for low score whereas AC Origins was full of grind but still has high score than Days Gone so as AC Odyssey. Also consider the fact that “Bend Studio’ is not AAA studio with budget like Rockstar games but still they did great job with Days Gone. This review is solely based on my opinion and this coming from the guy who absolutely loved playing Witcher 3\, Horizon Zero Dawn\, Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Last of Us. If you liked playing these games that I mentioned go ahead and buy Days Gone I am sure you will enjoy it. Remember reviews that matters the most are “YOUR OWN”.

Sony gave Bend Studios as much freedom as they wanted - and it shows\, and thats why its so different from all other famous Sony excluse titles. Surely this game has its flaws\, framerate is not always stable and so far audio glitches have occurred from time to time\, but these problems will most likely to be fixed\, so no drama here.

It's a beautiful open world with a lot of weapons and tactic options (stealth vs all out force). The random horde encounters\, sometimes even during an ongoing mission\, can be hilarious and/or terrifying. Having to monitor and plan for fuel is a fun twist that keeps things interesting. The story has a lot of common cliches but it's still entertaining and the voice acting is excellent. The map by end game is HUGE. Bike customization is a little limited but nice and I wish the outfit could be customized as well.I don't have as much time as I used to for gaming\, but I had a blast turning this on and spending a couple hours at a time busting up some freakers.

I almost cancelled my pre-order after reading all the negative reviews\, but after around 20 hours in\, this is already my favorite game this year.  Absolutely love the atmosphere\, visuals\, sound\, and gameplay.  The story and characters aren't mindblowing\, but they're good enough to keep you interested and motivated.  There are a few audio bugs that were annoying\, but nothing remotely game breaking.People talk about the game not innovating\, but I have never played a game with massive hordes of fast moving zombie/freaker enemies like this.  All the enemies in the game are dynamic and interact as well\, so you never know what you will run into.  I have seen a massive horde invade a marauder camp and easily wipe out all 20 of my enemies while I hid in the bushes in a thunderstorm.  Coolest thing I have ever seen happen dynamically in a game.  Other times\, wolves and bears will take down freakers for you\, or you may catch them feasting on enemies you recently took down.  The setting is also unique\, and helps to build an amazing atmosphere that just feels right.  The developers did an amazing job with the world and location\, making it feel alive and more apocalyptic than any game I've ever played.  The Pacific Northwest thunderstorms\, rain\, and fog look perfect\, and build the perfect setting for this type of game.   I would even say it nails the atmosphere better than almost any zombie movie ever has.  Truly amazing work!The graphics here blew me away as well (PS4 Pro).  I would call it a tie with RDR2 for best looking open world game of all time.  Textures are perfect\, lighting amazing\, and the animations and physics are great as well.  A few times I have seen the physics get wonky\, but nothing too distracting.  Little touches like bodies that don't disappear for days\, accurate dismemberment that isn't overdone\, amazing foliage and ground textures (best I've seen) and dynamic puddles and accumulating snow really stand out.  The controls are also great as well.  Everything feels incredibly smooth.  The handling of the bike and the shooting take some mastering\, but stick it out and you get used to them and learn to love the controls.  They also improve a ton with earned upgrades.The main character is a little quirky and weird\, but overall fun to play.  The dialog is the weakest point of the game imo\, and Deacon will randomly yell at characters out of context or sound out of breath at odd times.  Overall though\, it does a decent job of making you care about the survivors.  The hordes and enemies are the real stars of the game though.  The first time you randomly come across a horde of 100+ freakers at night in the wild is absolutely terrifying.  Once\, I ran out gas at night and was pushing my bike back to camp when they spotted me.  I fought (ran) valiantly\, but needless to say I didn't last long.One thing I haven't seen any review cover is the balance of actual gameplay.  It is a great game if you like just wandering and exploring like me.  The way that fast travel is unlocked by powering up NERO camps and clearing the roads\, tunnels\, and infestations between them is really unique and refreshing.  The sense of advancing and growing is great too\, as your character both improve a ton and you can feel the change.  You also feel like you are making a difference in the world as you eliminate hordes and infestations.  All great stuff.  Challenges are very different if you are fighting a few freakers\, a horde\, a bunch of gun toting humans\, or a freaker bear.Overall\, this is a top 5 game of the generation for me already\, and I'm not even half way through the game.  I know reviews are subjective\, but I don't see why this game is getting dinged so hard for issues every game has.  Even if you are burned out on zombie and or open world games\, you should give this game a try!… Expand",True,0.8361158967018127,0.9489662051200867,0.5454738140106201,0.8938370943069458,0.9152729511260986,0.7810176014900208,0.3523271679878235,0.8538028001785278,0.38427573442459106

Glad I found the user reviews\, who correctly informed me that the game was better than the pro reviews indicated. It's a solid 8.5 to 9\, and if you like Far Cry\, RDR\, AC\, you'll likely enjoy this one.After playing through 75% of the game\, I've re-read some of the reviews that initially put me off\, just to see if I could figure out the disconnect.Gamespot gave it a 5/10. IGN gave it 6.5 of 10. Most of the complaints they had about the game were\, interestingly\, completely true! What they considered complaints\, however\, weren't always problems. Technical complaints (bugs\, glitches) definitely were problems for some people. Aside from that\, though\, they identified things in the game that were repetitive or seemingly disjointed\, and they weighted these problems more heavily over the aspects that made it fun to play. The game is a blast in a lot of ways. Yeah\, it's got a weird moment or two where you think\, \""Why did they do that?\"" but it's hardly worth penalizing the game's score over. I know there's always the subjective nature of how people interpret art\, but usually\, game sites make their bread and butter by being generally correct in a review. In this case\, there's a big disconnect between the game's details and the overall experience of playing it (which should be reflected in the final rating.) This is NOT a 5 or a 6.5 game. It's fun and enjoyable and feels like an 8.5-9 game.Some people have criticized the acting. The acting is stellar and part of why I enjoyed playing it so much...it was surprisingly varied and different from other games. It's not the actor's fault that Deacon is yelling at times when others aren't; that's the fault of the direction or the people who instructed the actor to shout to overcome motorcycle noise\, when it wasn't necessary...and the fault of QC for not correcting things like this before release. However\, it's hardly worth deducting a point from the score.Some people have had technical issues. Those are the most damning critiques\, I think. I haven't had a single problem other than rare frame rate drops while bike riding in the southern regions\, but I hear a few horror stories from other people. That's a problem. Supposedly the patches (1.09 as of this writing) have fixed most of them\, but the game shouldn't have been released until it was more polished. This was a fair criticism in the pro reviews.Frankly\, the most irritating thing about this game is using the square button to pick up an enemy's dropped weapon when what I want to do is loot. Far Cry does this\, too\, and it's always been irritating. Making a weapon swap should NOT be the same button as looting\, ever!The game\, for the most part\, has been exhilarating and fun. Scary as hell in some places. Funny and touching in others. I don't care for forced stealth missions (as the IGN review correctly critiqued) and I think they could have eased me into how to fight a horde a little better than how a particular story mission tries to do it\, but again\, these things are not worth shedding a point over. It's still an 8.5-9 game. Gamespot complains about going on a hunting mission. So what? You can keep hunting if you want. Should it have come earlier in the game? OK. Lose a point over it? No way.Glad I ignored the pro reviews on this one. Every game is a \""to each their own\"" like of thing\, but as someone who enjoys open-world games and the likes of Far Cry\, AC\, RDR\, Fallout\, etc.\, this game totally rocks and has been a lot of fun\, and I'm glad I took the risk and bought it.

The story was my main gripe: it wasn't as deep and emotionally gripping as I thought it would be (coming from someone who played TLOU and Telltale's/Skybound's The Walking Dead game Saga among other well written narrative-focused properties) and I did not see the chemistry between Deacon and Sarah. They had little to nothing in common with each other and it was super Hollywood cliché with the whole opposites attract myth. The deeper/genuine interactions were with Rikki and with Boozer\, quite ironic since Sarah was Deacon's main goal all along.Also that plot point regarding Sarah's research was so predictable throughout the game\, that I rolled my eyes upon its uncovering. It felt poorly delivered. It was that Syphon Filter reference (in the background as a collectible in a lab\, mind you) that felt like the actual twist to it all (and the final conclusion to the NERO sub plot). I'd like more *crunch* in the follow-up game's narrative. Better context\, build-up\, development and motivation for one's actions. More tensions\, cognitive dissonance and more risk\, something that really holds a mirror up  to the player and says \""This is what your species can be\, yet be greatful you are in the safety and comfort of a virtual world.\"" It felt more by-the-numbers Hollywood/superficial in this game than minimalistic/grounded compared to other properties that hold this aura of dread\, determination\, and tenacious hope.Yeah\, the game succeeded in leaving me wanting more.

The bike is a joy to ride\, story and voice acting are right up their with the best games these last few years. Hordes are terrifying\, sound design is sweet. Gun play while not easy is fine and authentic. Fixing bike and refueling aren’t a chore for me and only add to the setting and feel.

The last one I remember being able to do that is the last of us. The game isn’t a masterpiece but it very enjoyable from running away from horses to hunting down the rippers. Too saving your brother and searching for your “dead” wife. I will say the twist at the 3 act of the game when you turn up at the military was quite a weird one I didn’t enjoy it at first but then I understood why it was there because it had been spoke about in previous scenes and segments of the gam.

This game was in development for a long time\, and it took way too long to come out\, but it is finally here. The game is well polished\, albeit there are some stuttering issues every now and then. The world is massive\, the characters are all voiced well\, and the story is fleshed out pretty well. The game delivers on the main thing that it was always noted for\, and that being ST-LOADS OF ZOMBIES!!! Wandering around the world is already kind of scary due to the loads of freakers and traps that rippers put up\, but when you run into a horde\, there is nothing else in the game that can cause that level of terror and dread. The main characters Deacon and Boozer are written very well\, and their voice actors really did a good job. The customization on your bike is also very well done. It kind of sucks that there really isn't much customization for weapons. Now to move on to some of the games negatives. Fast traveling takes up fuel\, which makes you constantly run the meter on your bike\, even if you only need to get somewhere near faster. The game\, while having a compelling story still is a lot of 'drive here\, do this thing\, then report to some dude to tell him what happened.' Another thing I absolutely despise is that credits\, the currency of the game\, are tied to their camp. An example is that\, say you have 5000 credits in one camp. Well\, if you go to another camp\, those 5000 credits are useless since they are tied to that camp\, meaning you need to get credits in the new camp. This can be a major pain if you need to upgrade your bike\, but most of your money is tied to another camp specialized in weapons. Lastly is freaker extermination missions. While these missions can be very easy if you have enough molotovs\, or have a ton of materials to make them\, these missions can be horrid to finish if you only have one or two nests left in the zone\, but are out of molotovs and their materials\, and have picked the area clean of supplies. This means you need to head to a new area to scavenge for\, most likely\, kerosene. Other than that issue\, I do enjoy extermination missions. They are fun\, but can be annoying if you run into an extermination zone while low on supplies. Overall\, the game is very fun and has a lot of things to do. The characters are written well\, and the banter between Deacon and Copeland especially is funny. The world is massive\, and the constant threat of freakers and the terror invoked when you run into a horde can constantly keep you on your toes. The world is very fun to explore\, and the various missions all running alongside each other means that just driving around will still take you to a mission. The game can be frustrating though with odd things like linking money to it's own camp\, taking fuel with fast traveling\, and the random-ish nature of ambushes. All-in-All\, if you are looking for an open-world slaughterfest filled to the brim with zombies and a compelling story\, I would recommend this game strongly\, but update it before playing seriously. On version 1.00 the game is prone to random crashes so be careful.… Expand",True,0.3724018633365631,0.5484638214111328,0.42636868357658386,0.9058501720428467,0.8903363347053528,0.48479095101356506,0.6477375030517578,0.7280006408691406,0.986170768737793

Days Gone is an excellent example of thought out emergent gameplay that is far more nuanced and original than you would expect. You have to plan engagements and be deliberate to survive. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing with combat being fluid but difficult (difficulty adds greatly to the fun). Hordes are as expected a technical marvel and very fun to encounter as you can also use them as weapons and watch the carnage.Story: I found Days Gone to start slow but really hit home as It got warmed up\, one Storyline in particular where you save a young girl was outright shocking but In a meaningful and well thought out way something that is present in most storylines (you get multiple). I genuinely think this is a great strength of the game.Graphics: Some of the best on the system to date\, the environment looks natural and the weather system is the best I have seen. I have found the frame rate to be quite solid (with occasional non-impacting stutter) on the PS4 Pro\, far better than Red Dead Redemption 2 that for me felt very floaty with an unplayable FPS (I never finished it because of this).Sound: Again like the graphics the sound is superb.Bugs: The game has quite a few however I have found that the devs have been very fast to patch and as a result during my play-through I experience very few and nothing that broke the game.Overall: This is a refreshing take on a genre I thought I would not play again added this is a solid singleplayer with no microtransactions and free DLC on the way (bonus points) Kudos to Bend Studios\, I look forward to what you produce next.… Expand",True,0.16049015522003174,0.2096032351255417,0.11997409164905548,0.859489917755127,0.6125034689903259,0.4374363124370575,0.21359792351722717,0.8979041576385498,0.1804625540971756

I'm glad I didn't.  This game is pretty cool and from my perspective deserves a much higher grade than it was given.  I'd say a solid 8.5.  There are 2 things that bring it down for me.  First of all the technical problems:  bugs and performance. There are more bugs that you would expect from a Sony exclusive title and the frame-rate seems to tank a bit during the more intense moments of the game.  These problems are fixable however so we'll have to wait and see what issues the future updates address.  The other problem is the control of the main character.  While melee works well and feels good\, shooting just feels a bit too slow as does general character movement.  Now for the positives.  For an open world game there's a lot to do and I never really suffered from open world fatigue while playing.  The quests are well streamlined to the extent that you really never even have to open the world map to get your next objective.  Also the game mechanic of having to manage your bike's fuel level will force you to do a bit of exploring to find gas\, which in a post-apocalyptic world you would expect you'd be doing quite a bit of that.   The hordes are probably the coolest and most unique feature of the game.  You do have to play for a while to get to them\, but the payoff when you finally face them is worth it and gives you some of the best moments of the game.All in all I'd say this game is worth a purchase if open world\, story driven post apocalyptic games are your thing.

I usually only take the time to give a negative review to games\, but after getting Days Gone and seeing how many things the game does not only right\, but fantastically right\, and seeing the hacks who clearly didn’t finish the game or are not experienced enough in the field they pretend to be knowledgeable in.The games biggest problems are minor system issues (on base PS4)\, and the games chosen genre.  Honestly\, the idea of another zombie game put me off this title initially more than anything.But the games positives are legion. The way the story unfolds so you’re not left with the typical open world dissonance of having a goal your character NEEDS to accomplished while constantly doing smaller tasks. Traveling is fun and easy. Locations are varied and typically rewarding to explore. I could go on and on\, but this is a meta critic review so I’m gonna keep it simple.The acting and writing might be the most organic and believable I’ve ever seen in a game. Especially the actor for Deacon. It’s the best acting I’ve ever seen in a game. Hands down. Microexpressions that you can read and understand\, dialogue and actions that stay consistent with the character\, I could go on and on. He’s done an amazing job as have the people animating him.This game is easily a 9. Probably even a bit higher\, but certainly not deserving of the low scores the pedantic hacks who make-up the ‘games journalism’ industry have given it.  Give it a rent if you’re on the fence\, but you will not regret buying it.No microtransactions\, no season pass\, just a great\, sometimes ground-breaking game that I hope sells gangbusters but God knows it deserves it.… Expand",True,0.2610296308994293,0.3146629333496094,0.23436018824577332,0.8682400584220886,0.46958479285240173,0.5206101536750793,0.29794058203697205,0.7143740057945251,0.5571177005767822

But I was pleasantly surprised and in many aspects\, it really brought something unexpected.  To me this an 8.5/10 game.Story: The story is easily one of the strongest aspects of game. At first the story comes off as cliché and uninspired\, especially in the first hours. However\, the story slowly develops into multiple treads\, and can develop side characters and the main characters a like\, at there's a lot of emotion and at certain point there is quite an impact.  I found myself heavily invested in a lot of the different plot threads and where they may lead to.  On the other hand\, the story long over stays its welcome\, and it starts to drag towards the end. Loosing that impact that it once built up\, and some twist are predictable or lack impact. Over all the story had heart and was a good time.Game play: The game play here is as open world as once can get. Everything you expect from a game like this is here\, from enemy posts to be cleared\, uninspired side missions(quests). However I found myself hooked with the game play loop and the development of my characters The different factions you meet and its currency system makes it so you have to make \""though choices\"" into developing you \""own character\"" and I liked that. My character felt unique to my game-play style.  the shooting is not fantastic but it’s not terrible. It is on the same style as Uncharted. needs more work doe but it does the job.  What I found myself attached to a lot was my bike\, saving for that new part or that new paint job kept me wanting to play more.  Over all game play was fine\, but it could use some work.Design and Performance: I played this game on a PS4 Pro. Over all the performance is all over the place.  Sometimes is really good and fun for 5 hours straight\, the next minute you are falling into the sky or glitching into a mountain with your bike.  However\, you can see a clear improvement with each update\, But it does reflect poorly to see 5 patches with in a week's release. The design and graphics are fantastic. At times this is a game that looks as good as sometimes like Uncharted and God of war. The weather and day/night cycle made it immersive and very seamless. Makes it for some great shots if you are into photo-mode.  The music is generic and but has moments where it lands very well with the atmosphere and complements the scene well.Over all I liked Days Gone a lot and I look forward to the sequel. I look forward to the next project by Bend Studios.  I am happy to see them work on something bigger. seeing their previous titles where much smaller in scale.

The story takes a little bit to get going\, but when it does\, it really is engaging and interesting. I also found the open world to be very beautiful as the game has great graphics and good animations. The soundtrack is great and the open world is very immersive and fun to play in. Some missions can be repetitive\, but I didn’t mind because I enjoyed the gameplay so much. The gameplay is fun and fluid\, but lacks the impact of a game like The Last of Us or Red Dead Redemption 2 as the enemies do not carry the weight of a bullet or melee attack as realistically. However\, it still is good enough to not make it a deal breaker for me whatsoever. The game takes about 60+ hours to complete just about everything including side missions and collectibles. I felt like the length was about perfect for the main story at around 30+ hours. The characters are very well developed and actually feel like real people\, although Deacon can sometimes have a few awkward lines during gameplay. The AI is a little dumb\, but it’s not nearly as bad as something like Assassins Creed so I think it is pretty acceptable. The horde combat is what really makes this game shine as it accomplishes something very few zombie games have done. The horde actually feels menacing\, scary\, and hard to manage\, but it is very satisfying to defeat one. The amount of options you can take to tackle a combat scenario is very large. If you can think of it\, you probably can do it and that makes the gameplay very enjoyable. The motorcycle also feels fun to drive and like a character of its own. I also thought it had the right balance of survival elements to make the game a little bit more immersive. The game does have some technical issues like cutscenes glitching\, enemies getting stuck in animation loops\, and some minor frame drops\, but these are probably fixable with a patch and don’t affect the experience too much. Overall\, I really think the game is much better than critics are implying\, but who really listens to IGN anymore anyways. They already lost their credibility. I don’t think this game is as good as God of War or Red Dead\, but it is still a good game that doesn’t deserve the hate that it is getting. The game has some issues that allow it from being the best of the best\, but I would still give it a 8.5/10 to round up to 9/10.

I think it would benifet greatly if they fix the minor (greatly exaggerated by reviewers) technial issues like pop in\, some minor stutter and frame jolts in the second area of the game among a few other nitpicks like increasing fuel usage early on and adding varied aiming settings for ranged weapons. It could get to a 9 if resolved. I can't recommend it at full price but the first price drop\, I say jump on it fast and hard. It's one of those games that people will be buying and making threads on for months to come wondering where the reviewers who posted 5/10 or less\, minds were at or even 6's which are ridiculous scores for this game.I'm just entered the last area of the game\, I think and the map is huge\, I also noticed that many of the reviews that I read didn't mention this area (It is very notable for reasons i won't spoil) which is completely gated off until a certain point\, well into the story and so to on the map. I think the hoards are great\, although they are such a challenge on hard mode that I am left thinking if I should just lower the difficulty to normal for them at least and switch back to hard for the rest of the game\, a tough decision to make. They are massive\, fluid and very\, very dynamic so much so that each encounter is dramatically differnet and I love how Bend have filled the environment around them with oppertunities to cause utter mayham (at leat the two I have encountered) it is a beautiful thing and so much fun\, even while dying so many times it shows just how different each approach can be and besides for some frame jolts (like a half second pause\, not a stutter or feame drop) everynow and then but very rarely it is near flawless. The other performance issues like pop in or texture dropping don't increase with hoards nor is there any noticable frame pacing\, in fact I think it is smoother than some of the some other intense instances of play\, bar that pause that is few and far between.I'm playing on pro\, at 4k in HDR on a 47 inch (or 49 maybe) It is a beautiful game\, stunning at times but oddly inconsistant throughout the world and between some cutscenes and sone others there is an inconsistent feel\, a lot of this\, I have noticed can be put down to the dynamic lighting as returning to some area can drastically change how things look\, even the textures can be greatly enhanced in some cases particularly high noon and the golden hours at dawn and dusk. Shadows really pop and create a painting like scene at these times. However\, that isn't to say the game looks bad in other instances like a storm in a forested area can look amazing\, rain streaming down while the trees sway is an atmospheric treat that reminds me of Tw3 with greatly increased fidelity to real forests. All in all\, it reminds me a lot of RdR2 and it's visuals\, with greater detail but much more inconsistency and some flaws like far off pop in of assets and texture loading issues pretty close up. These can be fixed and it's not anything heavier than God of wars massive load times and fram pacing at launch or The wither 3's technical issue's infact a lot less than the latter. The game ozzes atmosphere at almost every turn and it really hits you hard while exploring\, it can go from sunny and warm\, with happiness on top to cold\, damp with a feeling of dread in seconds and that is just a damn treat.Sound is an odd one\, it is great at times and horrible at others. The main character is absolutely fantastic and so is some of the supporting cast but this is brought down by techinal issues where audio overlaps or audio levels are different. This is easily fixed by adjusting settings on your TV and in game besides for the odd overlap of audio logs with a radion station or walky talky call when playing on a non speaker supporting controller or with headphones in. One thing that is fantastic though is the audio logs that play front the speaker if you are using a Ds4 with no headphones they are a really good use of that speaker and on top they are very well done and interesting.Something that is not a good use is the touch pad\, it is needless and pointlessly added to menus but buttons can also be used so perhaps a non issue unless you are unfamiliar with Ds4 or trying to play passively with one hand which will often give you menu prompts. And for that matter control in game is great (can be an issue to begin with) once you get used to it on the bike\, the melee combat\, the general camera are all smooth and great apart from gun aiming which takes a a great deal of time to master but does get better with certain weapon choices and configurations.The story presentation is the majour point of negative issue with the game\, seems like they want to tag… Expand",True,0.367207795381546,0.5744924545288086,0.33560749888420105,0.5039159655570984,0.5643045902252197,0.35591334104537964,0.05424770712852478,0.371732622385025,0.252174973487854

The technical problems in review copies has bogged down reviews but do know that these issues are at a bare minimum after patches.Well done to Bend Studios and I will be playing this game for weeks and months to come with free content coming in the next few months.… Expand",True,0.29560962319374084,0.2847849428653717,0.12100046873092651,0.6889007091522217,0.621097207069397,0.6884154677391052,0.21024565398693085,0.7383553385734558,0.4755958914756775

I don't write many of these reviews but when a game has me addicted like this I have to make a comment.

I don't write many of these reviews but when a game has me addicted like this I have to make a comment. A game must be something special if it makes me want to play all day long and not go to work! Not even Red Dead 2 or God of War did that for me!  It is so sad that these so called games journalists have brought the aggregate score down with pathetic and nit picky reviews.While it is not a perfect game and could be improved in some areas such as adding weapons mods and outfit choices\, more varied missions etc the game is still an absolute blast to play and experience. I've have not had this much fun with a game since maybe Dying Light. Taking on a horde of 300 freakers at the dead of night in the pouring rain is just so exhilarating! The weather effects are drop dead amazing and are probably the best I have ever seen on a console title. It really immerses you into the experience. This is a triumph in itself for Bend Studios so I really commend them on this fact alone.The story may not be the most original and creative but it is certainly very interesting and heart felt. It has kept me interested all the way through so far and after 20+ hours or so you really do start to care about these characters. They are human which means they are both good and bad and make both good and bad decisions. These are normal everyday people and while yes some are stereotypical those stereotypes do in fact exist en masse in this world (ie red neck bible thumpers etc).What really saddens me though about these low scores is that they seem to be from these ultra left wing SJW types with political agendas. There is little that makes me madder than reading that these morons had issues with Deacon being too white and too gruff etc having gone over the story with the political correctness comb and pulled out bits they found offensive to their ultra sensitive natures. I have little to comment about these comments from these people other than the fact that they are so pathetic they need no further comment and that's that.I am glad to see though that the overwhelming majority of the gamer community are supporting this fabulous game and I just hope that Sony Bend Studios takes encouragement by this and continues to support and add content and sequels etc.Do yourself a favor and pick up this gem I don't think you will regret it if you stick with it and give it the time it deserves.This title should not get any scores lower than 7-9 out of 10 but my current score is clearly an 8.5 or 9 as no title is perfect but this one is quite close!Highly recommended for those who love open world action/adventure zombie apocalypse themed games or survival games in general.… Expand",True,0.7803957462310791,0.18803653120994568,0.13880877196788788,0.6843635439872742,0.5836936831474304,0.37597233057022095,0.12811332941055298,0.6408398747444153,0.5918273329734802

93083,DG,2019-04-26,3.0,"Made an account specifically to give a short review. I apologize for almost maxing out the characters limit.Deecan is just a standard issue gruff n' tuff dude with no discernible qualities besides being \""a good guy\"". Cutscenes are paced weird and throw off the momentum of the story\, which itself is barely what I'd call a \""story\"". The biggest gripe I have with this game is how unfitting the gameplay is when it comes to what the game was suppose to be\, or at least feel like. A game about surviving a harrowing zombie apocalypse\, is immediately thrown off course when the first section of the game is a mediocre vehicle section\, followed by a boring Red Dead 2 style \""FOLLOW THE LINE\, LITTLE BABY BOY\"". It's also very inconsistent in giving the player information about it's gameplay mechanics. The game will happily tell you how to push the left trigger and then the right trigger as if we have never played a standard shooter game\, but when introduced to a low-profile stealth mission where being undetected is key\, it doesn't even offer the tip that you can stealth kill freakers just by getting close\, which I found out by messing around instead of playing the actual game. Which reminds me; the most fun I had with this game is being heavily non-immersed\, watching Deecan jump into a dumpster like he'd jump into his own bed\, and throwing rocks at freakers in slow-motion. Other than that\, it was a boring\, run of the mill mission structure\, along with the game telling you shortly in that you have chores to do for some dude. Speaking of\, immersion is not even a word I'd use to explain anything in this game. For a game that got the 'Sony Interactive Entertainment' stamp on the back of the box\, it really is undeserving of that title when the game constantly reminds me that I'm just playing a video game instead of being apart of the adventure. Applying bandages happens immediately and shows no type of animation from Deecan\, like he just shoots jesus juice into himself and keeps walking without any problem. Freakers have the same casual walking animations and it's easily noticed in large groups\, on top of those animations being less than 8 seconds long. Zombie screeches come off along the lines of a dog with peanut butter in it's mouth\, and nothing that screams 'infected\, paranoid\, relentless creature'. Deecan CONSTANTLY talking to himself like he's narrating everything he's doing\, where it comes off wacky and unintentionally comedic. Cutscenes fading in and out within less than 10 seconds of action\, obnoxious user interface constantly telling me that I gained a level or I completed a percentage of 3 different storylines\, also not even attempting to explain how skill points work and where to assign them. Technical issues are also abundant\, like camera issues when crouching\, and seeing assets load in late while walls and ceilings pop into existence as if the game farted in class and tried to cover it up.Overall (If you don't care to read through the above review)\, this game is uninspired and terribly mediocre. There are a few things that I did like about this game\, but it was mostly just watching the  burning trash fire that this game is. This game is a complete insult to the Sony exclusives before it. I understand that God of War and Spiderman and The Last of Us (which Days Gone should have drastically taken cues from) aren't perfect either and not everyone's cup of tea\, but those games clearly have polish and solid gameplay mechanics that are the defining titles of the system\, and the reasons to buy a Playstation. For as much PR and marketing as this game got like the previous great exclusives did\, it's a shame that it underperformed this badly. I hope that Bend Studios takes this as an experience\, and later on delivers a great open-world narrative game. I mean nothing bad by the people who worked hard on this game to put it out to us consumers\, but a fair critique is needed when this kinda thing happens. I really hope they learn from this.Here's to waiting for The Last of Us 2 and Death Stranding to blow the end of the PS4's generation out of the water and be a great transition to PS5.… Expand",True,0.6098706722259521,0.7730714678764343,0.29707255959510803,0.47559595108032227,0.5318756699562073,0.532522439956665,0.38010260462760925,0.499083936214447,0.7937586903572083

I liked most of the characters especially Deacon St John as he was kind of an anti hero but who had no choice to become a reluctant leader. The only negative I can say is the game was way too long which hurt the story as it began to drag. A lot of extra fluff missions that could have been cut out. *8.0*Graphics: Great quality. This game really is beautiful with probably the best wind and weather effects I've ever seen in a game. Environments were amazing to explore and told a story by the destruction and dead bodies scattered around. *9.0*Performance: Probably where this game suffers the most. I got a lot of frame rate dips\, pop in\, slow loading textures\, and glitches. The glitches werent game breaking but broke immersion *7.0*Sound: Guns sound realistic\, voice acting is great\, the music that plays when you come across a horde is perfectly exhilarating and gives an uneasy feeling. Weather sounds are immersive. Some negatives: there was some dialogue on top of each other with deacon talking to himself while listening to a recording. Also the way the characters speak they seemed to mumble\, say \""uh\"" and \""um\"" a lot which made dialogue very realistic but was hard to understand and follow at times. *8.5*Gameplay: Riding the bike felt very responsive.  A bit of a learning curve in the beginning but when you do it is very fun to control and drift.  The gas and repair system was a great addition as it really gave you the feeling of having to survive and use resources around the world.  You can upgrade your gas can and durability of your bike and it makes a huge difference so there is incentive to upgrading.  The biggest negative was the shooting. It felt very wonky and difficult to aim. Unlocking skills and slowing down time with your focus meter helped but it bad controls were there throughout the game. Melee however was satisfying and fun to craft weapons. Exploring the world to scavenge was addictive and rewarding. Random encounters and attacks from enemies were memorable and unpredictable as you can be taking down an enemy camp and then a horde of zombies will come and try to take u all out. Or a bear or wolves. The hordes are easily the best part of the game. They are so fun to take on and fun to redo to try different strategies and traps around the area. Humam enemy AI needs a lot of work as they can be downright dumb at times. As I said before there were a lot of fluff missions that should have been cut. There were literally some missions that were completed and you earned xp by just walking or watching a cutscene. *8.5*Avg overall rating *8.2*… Expand",True,0.5648634433746338,0.38792815804481506,0.15176698565483093,0.6436023712158203,0.8313239216804504,0.3620325028896332,0.26919424533843994,0.709100067615509,0.755222737789154

Well im a PS4 gamer and i was expecting this game for 2 years so this is my honest opinion on this game.Days Gone was supposed to be that big\, wow type of AAA game\, butIt is clear that most of the user reviews are by guys who dont agree with the score and just boost the user review section with 10s\, blaming the Xbox and PC community for the low scores\, without even finishing the game. Well im a PS4 gamer and i was expecting this game for 2 years so this is my honest opinion on this game.Days Gone was supposed to be that big\, wow type of AAA game\, but It happens to be the opposite. With all the buzz two years ago on E3\, I was expecting this game with an enormous amount of joy. Alas - all in no avail.The story aside - this game has a lot of flaws.First and foremost - the game is baaaaaadly optimised... Frame rates drop at almost motion stop animation while you ride your bike.. Pretty much most of the time there is enormous amount of lag while driving(and sometimes on foot). There are a lot of bugs too !!!! - I ve been stuck in a wall not able to move\, teleporting thru walls and fences and a lot of deaths followed cuz of these circus acts ive been a part of. Zombies flying around and teleporting from miles away is just the weather forecast obviously.Quests glitching and being stuck somewhere without spawning the npc for a quest is just a norm. I got 1 hour of videos made just with ridiculous glitches and failed renders\, which are mostly of cars.Unbelievable stuff on this point  ...Considering bike riding one of the better things in this game\, its just nerve wrecking to ride your bike in 15 frames per sec... Two year teasing the game and they get it out so poorly optimised? Cmon now...Second - no seamless transition between cutscenes is like getting back at least 5 years in gaming. You do something and suddenly - black screen for a second or two for pretty much nothing.. It doesnt feel smooth and its not nicely done either.Third - fighting is pretty boring and repetitive after a while.Its not that much of a problem but small things stack one over another.Fourth - the AI is probably the dumbest in gaming since i dont remember.. I literally 'stealth' killed three idiots in a row one next to each other while the others were looking at me and they passed around me simply cuz i was 'sneaking' in a shallow bush.. While i was stabbing one of the dudes the other was pushing at me while saying stuff like : 'yo where he is \, i lost him' \, 'hey why dont you come out an talk i dont wanna hurt you' WHILE I WAS STABBING HIS GUY IN FRONT OF HIM MULTIPLE TIMES LOL. Everything is made pretty much like they just found out open world and this game will be the stepping stone of open world\, while it is exactly the oposite - its years behind open world games..Fifth - what in the world is this thing with the flashlight for God's sake... His flashlight is in his pocket while the light is going around him with the crosshair... Bro wtf... Uncharted 1 was like 2007 and the flashlight there was pretty realistic - hangin at the chest while the light goes where the character is turned at the moment. But nah - lets make the flashlight like some theater light thats goes wherever you want while your character sits blank staring in the netherrealm.. I thougth it was some glitch or something for the first two minutes\, and when i finally coped with this idiocy i was annoyed at least...Sixth - repetitiveness is just killing this game. Wont dwelve at it much but it really is awful enough.Final verdict - the game is a huge dissapointment and even the nice graphics and fine moCap cant compensate for the dullness of this game. It feels like the guys who made it are a little bit bihind in terms of game inovations and gameplay. Theres nothing new in it for an open world game. Even the fact that they named the zombies in the game with the cringy 'freakers' and thinking thats something new and cool talks alot about the guys that made this game and what to expect from their game... Cool bikes tho.… Expand",True,0.7417733669281006,0.7938963174819946,0.6216357946395874,0.7618246674537659,0.8592022061347961,0.5740627646446228,0.44221392273902893,0.6903585195541382,0.5751007199287415

Sony Bend keeps their horde card close to their chest at all times\, only pulling it out a few times during the 30+ hour campaign. Bend knows that giving the player the ability to take on hordes from the beginning (such as World War Z) will get repetitive and boring. Sony lets the player go from frightened to even take on a few freakers\, to willing to take on three hundred at the same time. After 20 hours\, the satisfaction of killing hordes is worth it. The payoff makes the slower opening hours worth it .As for the story\, it's alright. It's no Last of Us or God of War\, but it's not terrible either. Some story choices are downright stupid\, but Sam Witwer's stellar portrayal of Deacon St. John and the stunning musical score make it bearable at the worst and amazing at it's best.Days Gone also features challenge mode\, each of which are completely different from anything you do in the main game. There is even a COD-Zombies-esque Horde mode complete with a mystery box.All in all\, Days Gone is worth its relatively cheap price of around 20-30 dollars on sale\, the reviewers can't seem to get the fact that Days Gone is a good game.

Having a hoard of i them behind you\, hearing them chirp and screech\, hundreds of feet slaming the ground gives you a rush. The Freaker wolves can run faster than your motorcycle\, which can make a simple ride down the road a ride for your life. The Freaker bears will give you pause as you decide between killing them (which takes a LOT of ammo) or just going the other way. The guns are also very detailed and sound amazing. Riding your bike is smooth and responsive\, however if you're not carefull it can get away from you resulting in a hilarious demise. The story of the game is good\, not great\, but good. Overall\, a good open world zombie shooter. Now the negatives. (This is a RANT). There are WAY to many cuts from game to cinematic\, the load time between them is too slow for a game made in 2019.

Which means you can't even walk outside without a armored environmental suit! You can't hunt or farm meat due to the risk of infection. You can't even live on land! You would have to live on a ship\, even then you still have to deal with the occasional infected bird\, not to mention the thousands if not millions of infected fish and sharks swimming beneath you... cheary thought.

The story starts off fairly rudimentary but becomes very good by the end... and for all the nonsense spouted about 'yet another gruff white male protagonist\, Deacon Saint John (as well as his friend Boozer) is one of the most likeable characters of this generation by the time you complete the game.The gameplay\, particularly the gun-play got some stick during the reviews but its down to it being an upgradeable skill. By the time you have taken your gun based skills through the skill tree\, the gun-play is as good as any third-person open world shooter.The graphics\, in much the same way as my earlier point around production values are a little rougher around the edges than what we have come to expect from most PS4 exclusives but there are still plenty of occasions where the game looks absolutely stunning. The music is fantastic also\, with a chilled out\, soft rock vibe that fits perfectly between the biker protagonists and the Pacific North-West.I also really appreciated the germane looting format. There aren't any 'chests' or the like but if you need specific items\, you have to look where said items would be most likely in the real world e.g. if you need ammo or guns\, search a police car. If you need medical supplies\, you should search an ambulance etc. Even things like alarm clocks (used for certain explosives) will generally be on the bed-side table of an abandoned/burned out home. It sounds a little thing but it adds a considerable amount of depth to the game world and immersion.Finally\, the Hordes are fantastic. You shouldn't really be attempting them until endgame\, as the skills and equipment that you will have by that point are needed to secure victory but the facet of the game is the absolute stand-out usp. There are plenty of them too. I probably took down four or five during the campaign but to get the Platinum\, I must have taken down another fifteen or twenty.

This is a rarity and this once again speaks of how much “Bend Studio” perfected their gameplay and the amount of content. In Days Gone everything is in its place and in perfect quantity\, at least in my opinion.The game is very long\, which is a rarity for 2019\, and a pleasant surprise. Though i’d like to point out that the final bunch of quests feels hasty\, as if the developers are in a hurry to finish everything as soon as possible. Also final quest feels undeserved and not hard enough for a grand finale which is anticlimactic and began to be found quite often in modern games.The NERO storyline wasn’t revealing enough\, and until the very end there was hope that there would be a chance to learn more about them. But maybe this is prepared for the sequel. I hope so.In conclusion\, this is a very high-quality game\, obviously made with an incredible level of diligence and passion.

No difficulty related or multiple playthroughs or missable trophies.

You play as Deacon\, a drifter who lost his wife and has spent his days traveling around with his friend 'Boozer.\""I'll avoid any spoilers so won't get into the storyline itself\, but it's executed very well. The characters are likable\, realistic and everyone is In the moral gray area. They behave like real people\, not superficial caricatures to \""teach a lesson\"" or pander. Even the worst villains\, you can at least understand how they ended up on that path. There aren't really any major plot holes that I can think of and it ends in a satisfying way.The game is open world so you can follow the main storyline\, do side missions\, interact with the several different communities you come across as you progress\, or just roam around. A few different types of zombies show up through the game with increasingly difficultly and the hordes can definitely be a challenge. The graphics are amazing and it really does look like the Pacific Northwest.My personal favorite about this game is how long it was. As I thought the main storyline was finishing up\, all of a sudden there's new locations\, new characters\, new missions and it ended up being twice as long as I thought it would. Playing this a few hours a night on average\, it took well over a week to finish. I hate when you spend a lot on a game only to get a few hours play out of it. You absolutely get your money's worth with this one.The two main negatives I would say are that a few missions can drag on a bit\, and a couple of spots can be buggy (I had to restart once or twice\, without losing progress though). Obviously both can be a mild annoyance\, but it really didn't affect my enjoyment of the game.I've already played it through twice and plan to a third time with the + option (starting the game over from the beginning but with all available weapons and skills you acquired from the previous play through). I definitely found this to be a fun\, entertaining and very underrated game.… Expand",True,0.27149683237075806,0.22118563950061798,0.22459840774536133,0.5690568685531616,0.39195892214775085,0.40356385707855225,0.3668607473373413,0.4496489465236664,0.6696484684944153

The Game takes a really long time and could be splitted in 3 acts. The First 1/3 feels a bit slowly but the atmosphere keeps you playing. After that the game begins to shine all around Camp Iron Mike\, this section was so much fun and very well written. The last act starts little boring but it all ends up well then. I really liked the lots of cutscenes even if they are quite short (but this also leads to a big problem).For the Gameplay I can say I didnt liked the Gunplay at all\, cause the hit feedback was very poor. Also the sidequests were all the same over and over again. But this can be done better easily in a next part. Also i wished we had a bigger section to play in a big City.The real bad part of this game and only reason I have to give a 6/10 is the brutally bad performance for a lot of the times. Its horrendous how the technique site of this game after all these patches is. FPS dropping like hell sometimes and without restarting the Game it will get worse. And then the loading screens\, they take you often out of moments\, especially if they show you a very little cutscene\, which is introduced by a longer loading screen (in some rare moments).All in all i would definitly recommend this game\, in its main party it is a brutally good Game and a lovely story.

You can tell a lot of time and thought went into Deacons past and present alongside that of the supporting cast who all have a little bit of baggage from the apocalypse. The voice acting is believable and really does feel like all who were attached this game put in their all to create this great spectacle.Some of the side missions feel very similar in their core but the way the world around comes to life the fun thing can be taking a camp down in so many ways\, stealth\, all guns blazing\, use the horde or even the wildlife to add some spice to how you play the game.Combat is a simple over the shoulder 3rd person view and is simple to use both whether using range or melee weaponry. There are all manor of hand guns\, msgs\, rifles etc. plus the crossbow\, lots of melee weapons of which some can be played around with and upgraded for greater damage and durability.Overall I would say it is a solid 9 out of 10 and very much worth your time and money to dive deep into the Oregon wilderness. I honestly feel that any negative reviews are from people who didn't get deeper into the game where the story opens up alongside other great new gameplay mechanics and areas which can only be accessed through progression.Go play the game and make your own mind up\, critics reviews are not the be all and end all as has been shown by the great sales figures and user reviews of this game.… Expand",True,0.480884850025177,0.31484347581863403,0.5161415338516235,0.797525942325592,0.43107762932777405,0.4610987901687622,0.47014400362968445,0.6563547849655151,0.7294355630874634

The Lisa storyline does a good job of defining Deacon\, but the Boozer storyline does not go anywhere meaningful in a long and drawn out first act. This along with poor shooting mechanics (which doesn't make any sense since Deacon is ex-military) and having to refuel your bike so much made for an experience that for a below average experience at first......Then\, the story really starts to pick up in the southern part of the map and this is when the game slowly starts to shine as upgrades to your bike and your character make the game much more bearable and the themes of the narrative start to come to light. Deacon becomes much more likable throughout the game and the strong supporting cast does an outstanding job fleshing out his character.There were some narrative failures such as the ending of the Ripper storyline which could've been so much more interesting as a conflict comes up is solved almost immediately and doesn't matter for the rest of the game\, but overall everything else contributed to the narrative and Deacon's journey.The best aspect of this game is the world. The dynamic weather system along with how the freakers act depending on time of day and the current weather lead to unique gameplay scenarios unlike any other open world game. This world will really come for you and it was blast to take it on! The story benefited from this as it did a great job utilizing the world to tell its story.Overall\, the game starts slow and stagnant but gets better as Deacon character develops.

Visuals look good\, although frames tend to drop every now and then especially when tackling 500 + zombie hordes.  Game can also be buggy at times but not game breaking.Sound is excellent\, guns really sound impactful especially the .50 cal sniper you get towards the end and the LMG plowing through a large horde.  Love the music\, you can tell when danger is lurking by the music picking up in volume and intensity.All the 'pro' reviewers criticising the protagonist that he's dull and there's no character progression throughout the game.  I agree\, but that's what Deacon is.  A what you see is what you get badass mercenary.  You get a short glimpse of his change before and after the disaster.  Love his one liners.  Voice acting is good not great\, you get Deacon sounding calm then hysteric the next sentence.The world is a very realistic setting of southern Oregon with real areas like Crater Lake and Wizard Island.  A lot of mixture of terrain from forests\, desert and snow.  Weather changes and affect things like sound.  It is easier to sneak up on a camp when a thunderstorm is happening.  Day and night cycles also affect you plan of attacks.  There are a lot of activities in the open world and LOTS of zombies\, infected animals and bad people to kill.  I find the open map much busier to similar games like RDR 2.The whole game really revolves around Deacon's bike.  You can only save (apart from autosave) your game when your near your bike.  It is your getaway when **** hits the fan hordes etc.  Your ammo replenisher when you are going on a killing spree and your fastest way of getting around the massive map.Once you've completed the game and get access to the highest tier of weapons\, traps and bombs\, you are ready to tackle the Hordes.  There are 50 hordes available once you've finished the game\, you actually do 3 in the main story.  It involves planning and having the right guns for the job (you wouldn't bring your sniper rifle) for this one.  Don't want to say anymore but you gotta prep and study the areas and the LMG is your best friend.Overall\, can't figure out why they scored this less than a 8.

Where I think a game like The Last of Us succeeds is that it uses set pieces and has climatic moments never feeling like a slog. Unfortunately for Days Gone that is what this game felt like. I think a lot of this game could've been cut out for time and if they did it'd been a tighter better experience.   Another issue I had was the motorcycle stuff. The gas management was only tedious I never felt like I was going to run out nor that it was the end if I did.

Add camera option to pull back more. When deacon gets swarmed i would love to see whats is behind him as im running away.3. Add different costumes that you can unlocked for deacon.4. Improve on the blending on animations so that swinging your melee weapon feels more satisfying.5. Add more customization for the difficulty. Like i want the enemies to be harder/smarter but i still want to keep aim snap.6. Add the ability to craft ammo instead of just giving away ammo for free or having us pay for it in game at home base. It will give me more of a sense of survival.This game makes me feel like a Man\, Masculine...which i feel is a bad word now a days.

The game does feel like a blend of HZD and TLoU\, if you like those games you'll probably like this. I haven't encountered a single bug just occasional frame drops. However frame drops are too be expected as this is one of the better looking games I've ever seen and it's pushing the aging PS4 hardware pretty heavily.The game goes for a naturalistic style in it's storytelling\, it feels unique in that regard but a good basis of comparison is TLoU. Characters and story are not as compelling as TLoU but that's a high bar and I think it's above average.  For me\, the story and characters are better than HZD.Gameplay loop is repetitive but satisfying\, you're mostly gathering resources to survive but as resources are scarce everything you find is useful. Things feel a little janky when you start the game but that's because they're meant to improve as you upgrade your skills so you actually feel a sense of progression. The gunplay isn't the best out there but it's by no means terrible like some people are claiming.I should mention that the menu's and interface are really well designed and well thought out. The controls are generally really smooth too\, it just feels good to play\, things have weight without feeling sluggish and transitions between gameplay elements feel seamless.Again\, a lot of complaints seem to come from people who barely played the game. For example\, yes you have to refuel and repair your bike often in the beginning but that's because in the early game your bike is supposed to be a piece of junk and you have to upgrade it over the course of the game\, so it actually feels good as you progress through the game and this makes what otherwise might feel like tedious open world fluff actually feel rewarding.This will be a love it or hate it type of game but I think most people who enjoy the gameplay style of TLoU will really enjoy it. Be skeptical of the \""professional\"" critics on this one. I saw one critic complain the game was too easy and only seconds later mention he was playing on normal mode. For the record\, there's a hard mode\, it let's you select it when you start a new game.… Expand",True,0.38123348355293274,0.20229870080947876,0.2376480996608734,0.5555258989334106,0.1718830168247223,0.5280102491378784,0.31387603282928467,0.30669087171554565,0.7635290026664734

I still haven’t completed it but I’m many many hours in and I love it the freakers are huge some in size but in number which makes it challenging but not impossible. Deacon St John is a character I thought would be very uninteresting but I’m doing every side mission so I can learn more about his past and the combat is fun. Very fun. The ways you can take out a horde and how it encourages you to play stealthy it’s brilliant it’s creative but not to the degree of where your making a gun that shoots exploding ducks but I like that it makes it realistic! My biggest scare is the voice acting and the acting I general I was playing odyssey but I think if anyone has played that game they know how fun that is but dread a cut scene because of alexios’s horrible voice but this game is like a movie! I cannot rate this game enough! It’s fun and I guarantee you the story will have you at the edge of your seat and your jaw will be at your feet!

They expect Sony exclusives to be of a class above the rest. If this were an Ubisoft game it would undoubtedly receive 8s and 9s across the board\, because you know what to expect from Ubisoft. True\, it is not up to par with the likes of God of War\, Horizon Zero Dawn\, or Spider-Man. But it is very close\, and there are a few things holding it back that I will detail first.Weaknesses:The transitions between cut-scenes and gameplay are jarring\, with random loading and black screens in the way that break up the immersion. This is definitely the biggest weakness of this game. Because it is so strongly narrative driven\, the poor transitions between cutscenes and gameplay serve as a detriment to a very good story.Facial animations are not up to the quality of modern games. They are what I would expect from the previous generation games such as Uncharted 1.Lastly\, the world and the side-quests are do not add much to the game\, and most of them are more like chores.Strengths:Narrative. Great characters\, development and voice acting add a very necessary and strong layer of depth to the narrative. Deacon is an awesome character that you will grow with and love. The story is very engaging\, and the writing is also very good.World building and Atmosphere. This is the major strength of this game. Bend Studios has created a dark and beautiful atmosphere\, where you can always feel the danger wherever you are in the game. It will really make you feel as though you are living through a zombie apocalypse.Graphics are stunning\, this game looks just as good as RDR2\, Horizon or Uncharted 4\, if not better.Combat\, missions\, gameplay are all very fun. Trying to deal with hordes is just as terrifying and difficult as you might expect.

92139,DG,2019-06-04,9.0,I’ll start off by saying Days Gone is a really good game. It’s not perfect. But it’s by no means bad. I just got done getting the platinum and beating all the hordes and really enjoyed my time. I think part of the problem Days Gone has with media critics is the state the game was released in.

I just got done getting the platinum and beating all the hordes and really enjoyed my time. I think part of the problem Days Gone has with media critics is the state the game was released in. As of this writing it’s currently at a patch of 1.09. 9 updates to a game with in its first few weeks is pretty bad. And figuring critics only got maybe 2-4 of these patches before launch I can understand their gripes. It just sucks it soured their opinions of a game that once fixed is awesome. So who’s to blame for that? Sony? I think the game needed a few more weeks of polish and i think a lot of outlets would have given it a 8-9 or even better. It’s currently my GOTY (though I’m still playing through Sekiro) it’s a very fun game. The characters are very likable especially Decon the main character. Sam Whitwer did a great job making Decon come alive and feel like a real believable person. Even though by the end of the game you can basically be a power house. With in the story he’s just a normal guy. The story is pretty good nothing mind blowing and has some obvious plot points but over all it’s a fairly good tale. I think the combat is pretty good. Once you upgrade and understand how it all works it’s fun and satisfying. Some of the game can get repetitive but honestly what open world game doesn’t. But I never felt annoyed having to do similar quests. I think the game went on a little longer than it should have. I have a few gripes but it’s nothing that really soured my enjoyment. Some gripes are looting. It can be a chore to loot. Having to hold down square and wait a split second sucks. Picking up the wrong things like enemy guns is annoying. Not being able to reliably find the loot you need to make things. Like late game finding bottles and other stuff to make bombs. Some story elements didn’t make sense. There were still a few bugs and frame rate drops but nothing game breaking at least for me. There was one moment where I was fighting a horde and the horde just stopped and I couldn’t attack. But I just moved out of the area and it all went back to normal with no progression loss. That was the worst bug I got and that was literally the last hour of my 100% run. Overall it’s not a perfect game but it’s really really fun. It’s charming and entertaining. And I really hope Bend gets another shot cause Days Gone 2 could really be a hit! And there is def room for more story in this world. If you enjoy really good games. Trust me you’ll like this. Don’t let the media make you pass this one by. Just look at the user scores vs media.

My biggest problem with the game is the survivor wheel\, it is very inaccurate and if you do not select the item you intended to\, it will probably cause you to die. There are some frame drops as I’m playing\, but I haven’t experienced any bugs. The AI is kind of lacking for what you would expect with all of the amazing games we have. There were several times when I was right in front of an enemy and they wouldn’t move\, get into cover nor shoot me. The missions are fairly repetitive\, but many open world games are like that (Soider-Man And Horizon Zero Dawn) With all of that said\, there are many good things about the game as well. As I said before the story draws you in\, the way you can utilize the world around you to destroy hordes is incredible\, you can even use the horde as a weapon against your enemies. And amongst all of the repetitive missions and side quests are random encounters\, being ambushed by marauders\, encountering a random horde or being pulled off you bike by a runner\, it all makes the world seem very dangerous and makes you nervous to be out in it. All in all I think it’s a good game and in a few patches once the frame drops and bugs are fixed it can be a truly solid game.… Expand",True,0.24044108390808105,0.24019140005111694,0.07285579293966293,0.7918024063110352,0.5908791422843933,0.32376036047935486,0.2164655327796936,0.6050330996513367,0.6146094799041748

So Bend Studio knew they couldn't delay the game again. They knew gamers were going to be very upset about these CRAZY bugs. So they announced early on they were giving out free DLC and challenges in the Summer and have all bug fixes. So we ALL WIN!!!The story is okay. It's not bad. The character animations are amazing. You can see the real life actors performance come right through the characters. The only problem is that we heard this story already through other games and movies too many times\, but the same can be said for the Marvel movies. Even  with this point it doesn't change how awesome those movie LOOK. This is an ACTION ADVENTURE GAME that is suspenseful at times. I tried to get off this game after an hour of playing but I felt like I was under the games spell and could not but the game down. I played for over 10 hours before I could put the stick (Dual Shock 4) down.Yes even with the bugs I really couldn't stop playing. I am a very seasoned gamer. I play ALL GAMES. I love how their are elements of so many other games in this one game. There is the Last of Us\, Uncharted\, GTA5\, Tomb Raider\, Need For Speed\, Starve\, Flower\, Mortal Kombat\, and more. This game takes a lot of other games and puts them in a one stop destination. Sneaking around and melee attacking freakers are so satisfying. I love how I can take any weapon in the game and use them against NPCs. Managing the bike is adds an additional  layer to the game where it feels like its own character in the game. It too can be upgraded and yes there is NAS.Days Gone has a buffet of glitches\, but not even that could stop me from having a great time. They are giving us free DLC and challenges. This is a MUST HAVE.And one more thing. This game does take advantage of the Sony's Platinum Headset with 3D sound. Hearing the hordes below you is so creepy.

Between bandits\, mutants\, motorcycle fuel management\, noise management\, hordes\, ambushes ... the danger is omnipresent.Narrative side and characters we are on the good\, the protagonists are realistic and the stories are interesting and convincing despite some wanderings and clichés. While we do not achieve the excellence of a TLOU but we can not help sometimes think of the title of Naughty Dog in terms of the post-apo atmosphere.You can also use the environment\, which will remind Horizon Zero Dawn to a lesser extent. The little extra is brought by the Freak-o-System that allows for example to make noise to attract mutants in a camp of bandits and cause a massacre without getting dirty hands.I liked: The heavy atmosphere\, the characters\, the freak-o-system\, the random events during the exploration\, the driving of the bike\, the clear interface (radial menu)\, the richness of the environment \, the beauty of the landscapes\, the variety of activities.I liked it less: bugs (collision\, sound\, ...)\, serrated immersion\, the rather crude infiltration\, the management of gasolineFar from being a masterpiece\, Days Gone is still a beautiful raw pearl with undeniable qualities.… Expand",True,0.06772154569625854,0.04019952565431595,0.014018704183399677,0.11974113434553146,0.07929780334234238,0.05153468996286392,0.028153294697403908,0.20252041518688202,0.0763464868068695

IObjectively speaking\, this game is fantastic.I didn't pay much attention to the build-up to this game and only heard about the buzz concerning its mediocrity closer to launch. After learning much more about it\, the open world\, survival type gameplay seemed like a good time but I went in with pretty low expectations.After almost 20 hours of playing\, I have trouble putting it down. I almost feel like I'm playing a different game than some reviewers. Most reviews seem to just bring down their score based on it being too similar to other games. While it shares many stylistic choices and gameplay tropes as other games\, it does everything so well and I can't for the life of me understand why similarity should be such a heavy negative against it.The gameplay is great and provides a wonderful sense of survival while not being too heavy handed. Everything around the motorcycles mechanic makes traversing and taking care of your bike a genuinely enjoyable experience. Something as small as the bike acting as your save point makes wondering the map a strategic affair. The constant threat of zombies in the open world is great and always keeps you on your toes especially up against hordes. It borrows many stealth mechanics from other games\, coming together to allow Days Gone to excel at taking out base camps and zombie nest locations\, incredibly stealthy. All the systems just come together to really make you feel like you're somewhat helpless in the world but capable if you're smart about things.The world is fantastic and exploring freely is both rewarding and tense. Not to mention the weather mechanics in the game are a sight to see. From snow gradually building upon the ground to the way the forest trees sway in a storm. There's always something to do and thanks to the light survival mechanics\, there are reasons to return to previously explored areas.The game also just looks incredible. It's visually up the standards Sony games have created and presents many cutscenes to enjoy the story. I'm not too far in the story and while it's not mind-blowingly captivating\, it does create enough interest to find out where things go and your main character is arguably the best part.The only real issue that doesn't by any means ruin the game but should be noted as an odd level of presentation is the cutscenes. There are constant black screens between all cutscenes\, even with several scenes back to back\, which breaks up the presentation in just a jarring way. It does stand out and seems like a strange thing they couldn't smooth out.All in all\, this game is great for anyone who is a fan of open worlds\, survival horror and most action games.

This is a human story and as you progress you start to get more and more invested in the characters and the world\, this takes me into the world\, its amazing\, filled with great detail\, incredible weather system and real gameplay changes depending on the time of day and the weather itself. For me the world is completely inmersive and has this funny thing that gives this feeling of mystery and suspense that makes exploring really fun and engaging.The gameplay is very good aswell\, i personally like the shooting mechanics because they feel responsive but there is this weight to it that makes you think about your shots and gives a realistic sense of danger\, of course you have focus and does make the shooting a bit easier. The stealth is solid with range and meele options and the traversal with the bike is really something else. By something else i mean that the bike starts feeling a bit unresponsive and sluggish at times\, but that is because you have a terrible bike at the begining. The cool thing is experiencing changes with every upgrade you put into your bike and you end up with a great bike that controls really smoothly.

The story and acting are good\, not the best out there\, butDays gone deserves a user review because so many of the critic reviews are overly harsh.  This game is a little rough in the sense of needing polish\, but the post release patches are rapidly taking that edge off.  What is left is a solid good time exploring an open world on motorcycle\, fighting zombies (freakers) and raiders.  The story and acting are good\, not the best out there\, but certainly enjoyable.  Combat is a little bit rough but more than serviceable.  Where the game excels is in creating a constant tension with scavenging\, and with the vital link to your motorcycle which is critical to your survival\, but requires care and maintenance just like your character and inventory.  I think reviewers in a hurry to get through the game and get their reviews out may have missed the point of the tension creating systems like constantly needing to scavenge and fuel your bike.  Perhaps the reviewers ended up resenting what is in some ways the point of the game\, creating an atmosphere of tension.  I often don't play this game for hours and hours like I do some other titles because honestly the tension gets exhausting\, but as far as making me invested emotionally it works well.… Expand",True,0.1664067655801773,0.11640409380197525,0.15590982139110565,0.6611307859420776,0.2285882830619812,0.42654627561569214,0.3195095360279083,0.6720200777053833,0.7251653671264648

The hordes are stuff of nightmares and you will be honestly scared when you face your first one\, same goes for the second and third\, a small error and you will lose against it. The Day/Night cycle is amazing as the need for scavenging. The world is reach with events and missions that are not necessarily available unless you happen to walk there at the right moment. The weapons and how their quality change their damage output and performance is brilliant\, you could have the best weapon in the game but have it in Junk condition\, and just be able to barely use it. The crafting is also very interesting and let you stock on materials and items to use later. The bike is not just a movement asset\, it does give you bonuses depending also on pieces you install on it.  The bad part and reason for not giving a 10: The IA from human enemies is somewhat lacking\, which makes the game enjoyable\, but would have contributed better to a terror environment if they reacted a little bit more natural when finding a body (if they do that at all)\, I would have introduced the possibility to carry a corpse to avoid being spotted\, alas\, that is not in the game.

Even though the frame rate slows from time to time (shocker\, a next gen game getting ready to move to PS5 and this is this studios first AAA game\, “oh no\, better give it a 1”.) the game performs phenomenally on the original PS4 and the grate rate never slows in combat\, which sometimes you have hundreds of zombies chasing you by the way.2.

I’m a lover of great sound design\, and I always have\, that’s one of the big reasons I love the Battlefield franchise\, the audio is amazing. Days Gone is on a similar level for me. From firing assault rifles to suppressed pistols the audio is just so satisfying. From the echo to the round actually being fired it just feels so immersive.4. Story. No issues with the story. I actually care about the main characters and whether they live or die or not. It’s not The Last of Us good\, but it’s certainly well done. Great job Bend Studio5. Gameplay and Mechanics: personally\, they feel very similar to The Last of Us with a slow motion effect (which makes sense). You have to use resources you find from the world and utilize those resources wisely. Similarly to the last of us\, many of the same resources are used to craft different items. The biggest difference with this game? Sometimes you will have 100s of infected chasing you and you have to make a quick decision. So not unlike red dead redemption 2\, sometimes you will have to use the slow time mechanic against hordes of 100s of zombies. Apparently IGN thinks that’s stupid for some reasons (except if it’s a Cowboy from the 1800s?).If you like Zombie/post apocalyptic/survival horror games and even just open world games in general\, this game is for you. It doesn’t get repetitive\, there is tons to do\, and the story is compelling.Do yourself a favor\, buy this game\, play the crap out of it\, and as always\, don’t listen to critic “journalist” reviews\, because they’re trash.

Bend is a smaller studio that has produced smaller games in the past and this is their first venture in the triple-A market so it is natural they will learn and improve over time.It appears unless Sony releases a 9 or 10 out of 10 games they have failed.Yet\, when you start playing the game you cannot fail to notice the beauty of the environment created and the passion of the developers in creating a compelling adventure worth playing to the end.No one from the studio ever suggested that the narrative would be as good as a game like The Last Of Us\, but there is a story and it is interesting enough to follow if you approach it through the lenses of fairness.The missions\, whilst at times are repetitive (and I have not seen a single open world video game that has not repetitive missions) are interesting and fun to make players want to continue to the end.The mechanics are good and have improved via the various patches released and the RPG elements (whether it is perks or bike upgrades) keep the game interesting and fun to play.In fact\, when I read that Bend wanted gamers to care about the bike I did not think it would be possible\, yet you are somehow forced to care of it as your life depends on it.When this game started receiving lots of negative reports even BEFORE it was released I decided to ignore the pre-judgment and have an open mind. Maybe this is why I have been pleasantly surprised by the game to a point I felt it necessary to come here and leave a review and a score.I hope the game sells well enough to give Bend another chance to create a sequel or a new game.

You get a 50+ hour adventure with a truly heart felt and gripping story with interesting and really well acted characters. All the open world activities are spread out amazingly in between chunks of story with plenty of cut scenes so you never get bored. There is no open world grind to be found here... In fact the way they spread the story out in this game is the vey best I have ever seen... The bike handles amazingly although some of the in-game character animations needed a little more refinement. A couple of bugs to be found but nothing that ruins the game. Combat is fine but I like to snipe everyone and go in stealth and this game gave me that in spades so no complaints. Hordes are terrifying! Oh and I loved the soundtrack...,,,,,True,0.23922571539878845,0.2973148226737976,0.3277246952056885,0.31240907311439514,0.42877230048179626,0.31610193848609924,0.2806960940361023,0.4297865331172943,0.3603420853614807
I generally never write Metacritic reviews but I had to come here and praise this game. This game literally took over my life for a week because I just could not stop playing it! I sincerely hope they make a sequel to this... I came from Ghost of Tsushima to playing this and I can say without a doubt that the story here left Ghost of Tsushima for dead IMO...… Expand,true,,,,True,0.23922571539878845,0.2973148226737976,0.3277246952056885,0.31240907311439514,0.42877230048179626,0.31610193848609924,0.2806960940361023,0.4297865331172943,0.3603420853614807

I am playing on PS4 Pro and there was one data streaming freeze for about 4 seconds when approaching the 1st camp with bike at high speed. So the game was loading in assets. Happens with a lot of games. The story is interesting\, it is not as good as Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Last of Us\, but it does have value. World is impressive and fun to explore\, zombies are terrifying to encounter. AI is not as dumb as some of the reviews say\, I think it is a perfect line between realistic and fun.In general this game may not feel super authentic\, because it is not. It feels like it is borrowing the best parts from other games in the market. I think they combined Assassin's Creed\, Far Cry\, Red Dead Redemption\, The Last of Us into one game and it works great. It is not magical game\, but what they achieved here is a really decent game.7.2 for this game is underwhelming in my opinion. I think it stands between 8 and 8.5  on the score table and I have had lots of fun with it.I am very happy my friend told me to ignore these stupid critic reviews and get it on day one which I did and I have no regrets!Good job\, Bend Studios… Expand",True,0.3927837014198303,0.23797115683555603,0.2034805566072464,0.5341911911964417,0.5598034858703613,0.3576333522796631,0.3262462019920349,0.4827132225036621,0.6195576190948486

92826,DG,2020-01-13,10.0,"Days Gone is a masterpiece!  I'm in love with this game.  I didn’t even think that she could conquer me like The last of us\, although these games are similar\, they are completely different\, and comparing them is stupid.  I want to say that in addition to The last of us\, Days Gone rolled my heart!  Although this did not happen right away.  I recommend everyone not to be disappointed at the initial stage\, but it will happen.  As they say the first impression is deceptive.  I advise you to continue the game\, and follow the script\, to the point where there is a hint that Sarah is alive\, after that the game opens in a new way\, with each mission you fall in love more and more\, you live in hope like Dick that Sarah is alive.  Honestly\, throughout the game I have several times rolled up a mean male tear\, it's all so much exciting.  Unfortunately\, it is not known for sure whether the sequel will be\, but there are hints in the end.  If so\, I really hope that it appears in the near future.  I also wish that the developers would continue to develop that chain of events related to the research of Sarah and what she wanted to achieve in the cave\, but it did not work out.  in fact\, why he and Dick decided to flee the militia in order to continue to work on Sarah's research.
