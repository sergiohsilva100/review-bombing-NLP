There will be quips between characters before things really start going. The film has darker elements, and appropriately directs the tone in that direction when required. But we aren't locked into a somber affair like some seem to want or expect. Second, Luke is where he needs to be emotionally in this movie. He even has instances where he explains himself. Other characters even comment on his current disposition, and yet fans still say he is out of character? Remember when he failed to lift the X wing in Empire, and sulked alone in the corner? Now imagine the gravity of his failure and what he wants to do about it. Others have claimed that he left the map with Lor San Tekka in order to bring him back into the fight.

Now, I'll discuss some specific complaints and tear them apart. Again, SPOILER WARNING \""""Luke thought about killing Ben Solo in his sleep even though he was just a young man? HOW COULD THEY?\"""" I have seen so many people try to say that this was out of character for Luke. Number 1. Who he heck stays the same in a 30 year time period? If you want the old Luke, stick to the prequels. This was character development that makes sense. Which leads me to 2. Don't you think if Luke saw that Ben might turn into another Vader, the thought to stop it early would at the very least cross his mind?? 3. He contemplated killing his father. Why not his evil nephew? I don't know why someone would into this movie thinking they were going to see Luke just as we left him at the end of Return of th Jedi. He went to an island to never be found. Obviously, something broke inside the man! And all of this developed into an amazing character arc and send off for a beloved character. I'm sorry you expected your childhood hero to be perfect and make no mistakes ever.  Another complaint I keep seeing is \""""What was the point of Snoke? I had all of these theories!\"""" I'm sorry, but who promised you Snoke was going to be the big villain in this story? Sure, you can infer it from The Force Awakens. And it's fun to theorize.

When you watch a movie, you are allowing other people to create a story for you. Let them create. If you want to make something, do it. I'd love to see anyone who is complaining try to make a film remotely as exciting and deep. Why can't we all just go along for the ride?   Have you watched the prequels recently? I don't hate on them like others, but if you objectively look at the situation, this new trilogy is a vast improvement. If you want a different Star Wars story, write one and stop watching these.

"Ignore the negativity from the 'die-hards'. The movie was awesome. It was fresh, unique, and had surprises left and right. It was the first time I've felt a Star Wars movie since Empire was unpredictable and had taken risks. The 'die-hards' need to let the past be the past. Not every movie can be a re-hash carbon copy of the originals. The biggest complaint against Force Awakens was that it was too much like New Hope. Now, a Star Wars movie that has brief touches with the past, yet separates itself from the old ways in a refreshing way does not satisfy them. Newsflash, you're not going to impress a new generation of fans with the same plot over and over again.

"The current low audience rating is a little ridiculous to me. This movie has its flaws but should never be ranked amongst the horrible prequels. Kylo Ren has become one of the greatest villains in Star Wars history. All of the scenes between Rey, Luke and Kylo were done really well. The action was good, there were some pretty good twists but nothing crazy. All in all this movie is definitely an 8/10 for me. I was entertained the whole time.  If I had any complaints it would be that they could have made it about 30 minutes shorter. The casino scenes weren't very good, I could have gone without those. Poe didn't have a great showing this movie either, at times he came off kind of stupid. And they never explained who the hell snope is and where the hell he came from.

"""MILD SPOILERS!!! As a HUGE fan of the Star Wars saga for entire life (and I've been around for every installment) I thought The Last Jedi, as a film, was one of the best ever made. There were some genuine surprises (which is hard to do these days) and great performances (particularly from Mark Hammil and Adam Driver). As a child, Luke Skywalker was MY GUY. I read an article about the movie which said he \""""wasn't just my hero, he was THE hero of my generation\"""" and I could not agree more. If you fall in this category like me, I can understand why you left this film a little conflicted, I certainly did. I was also disappointed with how severely they under utilized Finn, one of my favorite new characters as well as the Rose character, who I felt was poorly acted/written and out of place. She was a central character who was difficult to care about. Overall, with time to reflect, the movie itself was great and moves the franchise forward, making Rey and Kylo Ren even more the focal point, as they should be now. I don't understand the backlash, great movie overall! Seeing it a 2nd time only reinforced this for me.

"""Finally got to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  It was REALLY GOOD.  Ignore the naysayers and critics.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you will, at the very least, enjoy it.  And if you're a fan of some (or most) of the Expanded Universe (EU), then you will definitely feel good about the way it turned out!  ------------------------------  SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ------------------------------  SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  -------------------------------  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!  TURN BACK NOW, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  --------------------------------  So, my thoughts on some of the major points of contention in the movie:  -A little bit of silliness in it, especially at the beginning.  Yes.  There was some.  Especially the bit with Poe teasing Hux.  All I can say is, if this upset you, you obviously never watched the Prequels, The Clone Wars, or Rebels.  Those are all MUCH sillier and much more ridiculous.  Disney toned down the silliness quite a bit from where George Lucas brought it.  BUT, yes, there was a bit of silliness in there, and after The Force Awakens and Rogue One, I'm sure some people were hoping it would be gone for good.  But if the Prequels were a 10 when it came to silliness, TLJ is no worse than a 2.  It is not even remotely silly as Jar-Jar, 8 year old Annakin blowing up a battle station, C3PO having his head swapped with a battldroid, or General Greivous.  -The Rebel Alliance was buying weapons from the same arms dealers that were making them for the First Order!!!  Wow.  There's a shocker!  Why, it's almost as if there was some sort of civil war going on or something...  -There was an SJW message in it!!!!!  Congratulations!  You apparently don't know the difference between a Social Justice Warrior and a Libertarian!  Because that was a LIBERTARIAN message!  If you are not referring to the message the Code Breaker gave Fin, though, perhaps you are referring to the fact that Rose prevented Fin from sacrificing himself and said something about saving the people we love rather than dying for a doomed cause?  Now I'll admit, I was kinda hoping Fin would go through with it.  But Rose's actions  were her own, based upon the fact that she had just lost her sister for the cause and obviously had strong feelings for Fin.  AND, the fact that they were all willing to let Luke sacrifice HIMSELF for the cause more than made up for that!  -Kylo Ren is too whiny!  And Annakin Skywalker wasn't?  That's the whole point.  Be a little bitch and you will turn to the Dark Side!  -And, finally, some people didn't like the direction they took with Luke Skywalker...including Mark Hamil himself.  Well, if you have read any of the EU, then you were fully prepared for this version of Luke Skywalker.  I don't need to tell you about how he went into hiding for fear that he would make the same mistakes Obiwan did if he attempted to train any Jedi on his own, or that he feared turning to the Dark Side.  You were prepared for this, and you were pleased by the direction they took.  IF you are not familiar with the EU, then allow me to explain.  Luke was never some noble knight in shining armor that represented the epitome of the Jedi Order.  He longed for adventure.  He ignored his teacher's instructions.  He whined about things being too difficult.  He lied.  And in the end, he failed his final test against Darth Vader...the test that Yoda told him would make him a Jedi.  \""""Wait...what?!?!?\"""", you say?  He longed for adventure.  Something Yoda frequently warned him about, and something Rey never did (remember, she wanted to return to Jakku).  Rey was much more like Obiwan and Yoda than Luke ever was.  He ignored his teacher's instructions.  He went into the Dark Side Cave on Dagobah with his weapons, in defiance of Yoda.  There he faced his fear:  that he would be turned the the Dark Side and become a Sith Lord.  Then he ignored Yoda's orders not to abandon his training in an attempt to save his friends in Cloud City.  He did so anyway, and to what end?  He didn't save his friends.  Lando did that.  All he did was walk right into Vader's trap and put his friends at risk when they came back for him.  Sure, Artoo went with him, and it was Artoo who turned the hyperdrive back on on the Falcon.  But had they not been slowed down by having to go back and save Luke, the Falcon might have just told 3PO itself that its hyperdrive was turned off.  He whined about things being too difficult.  Well...that's a given.  There would be no infamous, \""""Do.  Or do not.  There is no try.\"""" line if he wasn't frequently whining about things  being too hard during his training.  He lied.  He told Jabba he was a Jedi when he wasn't.  He even asked Yoda later if he was Jedi, to which Yoda responded that he had one more test:  to face Vader.  Which brings us to...  He failed his test against Darth Vader.  Oh, he saved Vader.  But he tried to strike the Emperor down in anger and hate...EXACTLY how the Emperor wanted him to.  He gave in to the Dark Side.  He failed his test, and he did not become a Jedi.  Bet he was also not a Sith.  He was a Grey Jedi.  But that decision to give in to his feelings and strike down his enemy is also what allowed him to save his father, and bring him back from the Dark Side.    The direction they went with Luke in TLJ was exactly the direction they needed to go with him.  Rey, not Luke, was The Last Jedi.  And her behavior proves that point.    Oh, and how Luke used what remained of his life force to generate an illusion in order to hold off Kylo Ren and give Rey time to save his friends and allies was awesome.  I wonder how many people realized that it was an illusion from the moment he walked out of the blaster fire?  If that hadn't been indicator enough, surely him pulling out his old, just destroyed blue light saber would have told them?  Anyhow....  In conclusion...  The whining over this movie is nonsense.  It was a great movie.  Any Star Wars fan will enjoy it!",10,Last Jedi,100,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1

"Inception left me feeling agitated and disappointed. the amazing acting, beautiful cinematography and spectacular effects are wasted on a plot that just doesn't work. How do they share in each others dreams? Why does the lack of gravity penetrate one level of dreaming but not the next? Why are the dreams so bound by the characteristics of reality? It's a huge task to adequately represent the feeling of the boundless world of our unconscious minds and also tie it into a workable movie. Congrats to the director and cast for trying, but it falls terribly short. They even get the time-bending effect of being unconscious backwards. When I sleep 8 hours can fly by in the real world while in my dreamland only 30 minutes have gone by.

Or are they all so bored and turned off by his ego that he actually breaks actors?  And those who loved this movie are as predictable as Pavlov's dog-- you hear big noise, you like.You get confused, you think wow smart story-- no it's a cheap story. In fact this movie, in a lot of ways, is a lot like the Transformer movies. But instead of being eye-candy for the lemmings with IQs of 70 this movie is pons-candy for the idiots who have IQs of 70 but so wish they were in the 100 club. But Christopher Nolan is in the 130+ club (like me), and he knows he can get away with murder. He just hopes you were too far within a dream to care whether or not you actually enjoyed the film.   I just wish he would use his talents to make a good film one day... And I am starting to doubt he has talent. Perhaps his best skill will be utilized in \""""producing\"""" and revamping the Superman series. Here's hoping! However, I am going to stay clear of his directing cockpoles in the foreseeable future.

The gameplay is very good but there are still problems with the AI, but I insist that you cannot throw away everything you built in the first part, wasting many of your new and old characters for a goal that you finally did not meet.

But that is absolutely not what the vast majority of us are upset about, itâs everything else. The only moments that I was genuinely invested in were the flashbacks, and I do think thatâs all the game needed to be, not this new revenge plot. It just feels like they were trying to turn The Last of Us into something it just wasnât, and they strayed so far away from everything that made us love the first game.I went into this game with completely open eyes. I didnât see a single spoiler, thought the people who had seen the spoilers were overreacting and needed more context, was keeping a completely open mind, and had this blind faith in Naughty Dog because I genuinely believed that this would be the last studio that would screw up a story. Iâm just completely devastated because of what could have been. Through the game you could see moments of it, but theyâre the subplots, not the main one. The only character I felt invested in or even just found interesting was Dina, and personally I just couldnât get enough of her. But as someone who grew up with Ellie, was a similar age and really just related to Ellie, the fact that she wasnât on the forefront of my mind throughout this game was a big miss, and it just feels like to me that they butchered her character for the sake of a message. On top of that, it felt like they were trying to hard to compare (insert name here)âs story to Ellieâs, and it just didnât feel natural. Whilst I could see what they were going for, they just couldnât pull it together, with an ending that just made me ask the question âwhat were they trying to do here ?âMy only hope for the future is that Naughty Dog can learn from this, because I honestly think itâd kill me to see this happen to Uncharted, another series I love so freaking much. The main problem they need to learn from in my opinion is that you canât build a story around a message you want to convey, itâs the other way around. Iâm still going to support them because this (for me, at least) will be the only blip on their record of fantastic games, and I do really look forward to seeing the stories of Chloe, Sam, Nadine and even Sully continue on. I do, however, think they need to leave The Last of Us alone for the sake of their fans. TL;DR: The Last of Us: Part 2 gives me the same feeling as season 8 of Game of Thrones all over again. Everything about it is perfection EXCEPT the story, which given the fact itâs a Naughty Dog game of all studios, shouldnât be the case.

This game is one of the greatest narrative absurdities of the last decade.I understand what they tried with the game, the problems is not the idea, it's the execution of it. The game guides you all time to hated with Ellie and trying to emphatize with Abby. The problem is that they did that so poorly.The only reason I give it the 2 is for the recreation of scenarios, visual effects, art and soundtrack.â¦ Expand",1,TLOU2,233,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

"Iâm honestly at a loss on how this game could stray so far away from its roots. Personally Iâm tired of beautiful games that are just shallow in lore, stories, and interesting characters. While ND has continued to show their ability for map design and lighting, the gameplay seems to be almost untouched on improvements since 2013. Gunplay seems clunky and AI running straight at you with zero evasive ability while you clearly have a gun drawn on them feels brain dead. Not to mention the amount of bugs I experienced was something I expect from EA.  THE STORY.... where to even start? The disrespect for Joel, the unloveable Abby, countless NPCs Iâm supposed to care about but donât... half the game spent trying to manipulate my first impression. Going on a murderous rampage for revenge, only for absolutely no pay off. I felt like the one being spit on.It felt like there could had been a completely different arrangement of events to kill Joel off (If you absolutely felt the need too) and introduce Abby. A better back story and flash backs of the fireflies vs the Gov, memorable events from the last game sprinkled in as the trickling effects of Abby story is shaped by Joel. It all felt hollow and rushed like the narrative was so forced, the writers couldnât even stomach enough to put typical ND effort in. Iâve already sold my copy to someone else as thereâs zero Replay-ability due to the lack of MP and the fact I wish I could just get my time back from this game. I really tried to give it the game a chance even though I deleted/redownloaded twice out of pure distaste.

I really felt like it was the perfect horror game experience. Play this game alone at night with either headphones or surround sound cranked up and you will be jumping out of your seat. It does a great job drawing inspiration from various horror movie styles, and balances some excellent in your face jump scares with the slow burning tension of subtle creaks and groans. Being that this title is more like the early resident evils the gameplay is more in the scouring of items, inventory management and exploration through expository story telling and puzzles than the actual combat. This is no gameplay tour de force like Resident Evil 4, If you go in expecting that you will be disapointed. It is clunky and slow paced on purpose. But what it does it does really well, namely drawing you into exploration and scaring your pants off. I felt the game had a perfect length as well, and some minor incentives to jump back in for a second play-through. All in all in my opinion exactly what the franchise needed.

The enemies, there's more than just the bakers, there's the molds and others that i will not spoil. The gun mechanics are great. The gameplay gets a 10/10 again.
