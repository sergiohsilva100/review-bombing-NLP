If you took the title away anyone would believe this game to be something new as a matter of fact the only thing resident evil is the Resident in residence 'oh look another horror game based in a mansion.Camera: as I said this game has been designed for VR but sadly it seems as though Capcom thought they'd base alot around this\, slow clunky movement in first person\, no over the shoulder view if they're going to give the game a nod back to the original games why put it solely in first person why not give controller players an option to switch it's not like the game is cheap give us variety I wouldn't suggest this to anyone planning on using a controller\, it's a shame they deviated again from what they originally had. I've played games which use the first person POV and they are some of my favourite; Aforementioned Outlast\, The Evil Within\, Dying Light\, Dead Island all work perfectly but that's because Capcom haven't focused on the here and now but instead the future of what if 's (the what if's being VR) limiting players to really one game play mechanic 'VR.'I also felt some functions where limited; option to toggle flashlight on/off\, assigning items\, using items at certain points for instance nothing is happening directly to Ethan but a character is off interacting with another thing you have to wait for that character to finish fiddling around before you can heal\, switch weapon or reload something I've not seen in other games from the franchise unless it's been a dedicated cut scene which you'd expect anyway but when you have your inventory open smacking 'X' over your herb or first aid you'd expect it to work at that 'cool down from the action moment.'This game has one good thing going for it\, it is a scary game well I say scary what I mean is it makes you jump a little at times you'll hear a noise off to one side and turn to look at it; sorry 'SLOWLY turn to look at it inaccurately'  because the controls are bad on a controller I can imagine in VR it would be faster\, immersive and scarier\, the story is good but as I mentioned it feels alot like it could be a rewrite of Outlast or even a spiritual successor to The Evil Within a good POV game.I just wish Capcom had made the game a little better it is 100% not worth the price tag\, it doesn't feel like a resident evil game I could only find a reference in the title so how could it\, it caters to a newer audience an audience who has just picked up from 5/6 not long time gamers like myself.It makes me sad knowing honestly I wasted big bucks on a game I don't like and will be taking back to the store tomorrow for credit towards something else.longtime fans think twice before you buy I'd highly advise this.One of my biggest genres is Survival Horror games and I like to play alot from the genre I just cant justify the price nor can I back the game play as a longtime fan to the franchise.

89890,RE7B,2017-02-19,8.0,"[Shortened]In some ways Resident Evil 7 brings the series back down to earth and back to its roots\, and yet in others it is even more fantastical than the last entry. Thankfully\, one thing it does well is craft more believable and entertaining boss fights and encounters. Every enemy seems thought out rather than hastily thrown at you like Resident Evil 6 was wont to do. The Bakers and the other more powerful adversaries each come with their own specific methodology to battle\, although a much more prepared player can potentially blitz their way through earlier encounters with sheer firepower and determination. Action is still a large part of the game\, but it has taken a step towards being more cinematic so that the bulk of the experience can be returned to its horror roots. It makes for a better and overall more enjoyable and tenser experience to be sure. The gunplay and most melee moments are handled quite well although there are some unexpected hiccups here and there specifically where reactionary movement is concerned with special weapons. On the whole however\, the first person perspective increases the enjoyability of the well-oiled combat both aesthetically and physically.All things considered\, Resident Evil 7 is the return to form that the series needed even if it ultimately doesn’t change things up quite as much as it probably could or should’ve. It is by no means Resident Evil 4\, but then that isn’t necessarily a bad thing either. It stands largely on its own although there are still obvious and subtle connections to the rest of the series\, making it a tad clearer than expected as to just how it fits in with the other titles. The expansion of the universe and video game lore is welcome and for a series that constantly retcons its own ideas and even who’s alive and who’s dead\, it largely adds onto the Resident Evil fiction without taking anything else away in turn. Given the chance\, whether you’re a newcomer to the series or a longstanding fan\, you should give the game a chance- it’s as good a jumping on point as any\, especially given the lack of need to know information considering past titles.Concept: Reinvent the Resident Evil series as we know it\, adding a breath of freshness to a series that has otherwise begun to grow stale over the years. Introduce new characters\, a new plot\, and new gimmicks along the way.Graphics: Particularly great animation and environmental work adds ambiance and aesthetic thrills to the tense adventure. Add in the fact that limbs are lopped off and gore is always present and you have a graphically sound and impressive piece of work.Sound: There is often little to no sound and yet that works in a genre such as this. When there is something to be said or done\, the voice acting is about on par with most triple-A titles and doesn’t disappoint. The minimalist soundtrack ratchets the tension at all the right times as well.Playability: Exploration and tense combat are given their equal due and are the largest elements in play throughout the game. It handles well for the entirety of the campaign and is an incredibly well-played experience to boot.Entertainment: Most of the entertainment can be derived from the expansion of the lore and in-game details strewn about the world. Making subtle and not-so subtle connections to the other games in the series is what Capcom often does best and it works here better than it probably ever has before. In an experience that could’ve been largely standalone\, Capcom unites Resident Evil 7 with previous titles in thrilling and interesting ways.Replay Value: Moderately High.Overall Score: 8.0… Expand",True,0.3377324640750885,0.3999681770801544,0.18445728719234467,0.8984405994415283,0.43678927421569824,0.5049968957901001,0.25381895899772644,0.5751482248306274,0.3361837565898895

89903,RE7B,2017-10-25,7.0,"I was not thrilled by RE7.The series took a turn from the classic 3rd person view to a 1st person\, usually associated with other horror games (and shooters\, of course). The story is a rather personal one\, and we do not get the usual big game tragedies we have come to expect from Resident Evil Games ever since the 1st one. I cannot complain that this is a bad game; however\, I am not sure that it is a Resident Evil game: aside from a few facts (not mentioned to avoid major spoilers) and scenes that could had been left out without substantial change to the game or\, to be more accurate\, were included for no apparent reason other than branding it Resident Evil\, there is literally nothing that justifies this game being launched under this franchise. I understand that many people may not consider this important if they are enjoying the game\, but managing expectations is also justifiable: if one buys NBA 2017 and ends up with a baseball game\, maybe they will enjoy it very much... but that's not what they wanted to buy.Of course\, one should always read reviews etc before buying\, however I am not sure that the reviews can adequately explain how different this game is: it needs to be played in order to be felt.Aside from this most obvious criticism\, I was not thrilled by RE7; although it has its moments\, it also has its flaws: in my opinion\, the boss fights are appalling! tThey do not convey any feeling of horror nor any feeling of achievement once they are completed\, but merely serve as vehicles to move on to the next level\, which by the way takes mostly place in the same locations. So\, all in all\, I think this is an entertaining and well-made game\, but not anything special. I have higher expectations from the company that once gave us RE4\, easily one of the best games of all time\, and I hope that their next release will focus on recreating the feeling of being lost in a creepy world of horrors\, terrible monsters and ridiculously outrageous conspiracies to destroy mankind\, and not just in some old farmhouse with a monster family that doesn't right out kill you for any other reason aside from letting you play the game...Overall\, this is nothing more than an above average survival horror game.… Expand",True,0.23152945935726166,0.15268582105636597,0.22866658866405487,0.7071854472160339,0.20059791207313538,0.19739677011966705,0.14896254241466522,0.6281152963638306,0.9382525682449341

As someone who has played 1000s of games from Atari to PS4 I have never felt this sick while playing a game until I played Resident Evil Biohazard\, I was playing on a regular HDTV and I had to take breaks every 1 - 1.5 hours because I would get terrible headaches and some nauseousness. I found that playing with the lights on reduced this dramatically but It's more fun to play games like this in the dark.The atmosphere and sense of dread were amazing and the mystery kept me coming back. Unlike many modern survival horror games\, RE:7 didn't rely on jump scares and loud noises to startle the player. The atmosphere\, in general. was unnerving and gorgeous. The sound design especially was on point; from subtle background noises to the score itself\, RE:7 was on point. The visuals were very good\, especially the characters models\, but there were a few times that textures would get muddy upon close inspection. This seems a little strange as this franchise is known for making the player look through everything in detail.I found the setting the game in the Louisiana bayou to be a fresh change of pace that allowed for new and interesting environments. Without going into spoilers there are more areas than what are seen in the trailer and a few in particular were new and unique.Capcom used a few awesome new story-telling method such as interactive VHS tapes. These tapes found around the game are used to give insight into the past and depravity of the Baker family. Upon inserting the tape you take control of the individual holding the camera. These are particularly engaging and fascinating as they allow you to explore the same areas long before the events of the game. This leads to some fun puzzle solving and rewards if you paid attention.When it comes to combat it feels pretty good. The gunplay isn't perfect but it's not unfair. I was glad to see that Capcom when with a RE:5 style of shooting instead of something more akin to Resident Evil 4. The ability to move while looking down the scope in RE:4 felt unintuitive to me. The enemies aren't extremely varied. You have a handful of typical grunts and then you have the main characters/bosses. The first two\, in particular\, reminded me of nemesis which really put me on edge. Irritatingly\, the final boss was far too easy.This game does deviate from the tried and true and that's why it shines in my opinion. Sure\, you still have item boxes\, standard inventory management\, and some overused horror tropes but this game but it stands on its own as an amazing game. Just don't expect to be forced to backtrack through the same area 7 times because the developers thought it would be fun to include one-way doors near critical locations (I'm looking at you Resident Evil 1 & 2). There's decent replay value if you are looking to find all the collectibles and optional weapons. There are even multiple endings and a free story add-on that will come as DLC in Spring.The first person POV and chilling atmosphere make this a terrifying game and I applaud Capcom for trying something new with a well-loved series. This was was Resident Evil needed and I loved it.

We copy and say that \""This is a new approach to the series.\""Let’s sign in order not to dump everything. The painting will be: Plot\, gameplay\, atmosphere\, and so on. That is\, point by point. Go.1. The plot. Was he there at all? Don’t get it wrong\, there’s something like a plot\, but it’s only in notes\, that's all. This is not Dark Soules\, where the main plot in the descriptions of objects. Speaking bluntly\, there is no plot. I do not consider notes for the plot. They simply tell you\, \""You have come\, there is a virus\, go save\""\, what\, why\, why\, how\, and do not give a damn. Again girls\, I'm not in 2005\, I'm in (at that time) in 2017\, alo\, enough to exploit little girls. I do not play F.E.A.R\, I play Resident Evil. In the seventh part there is not even a plot twist\, it immediately burns at the very beginning of the game. The game does not entice\, neither the plot nor the more gameplay.2. Gameplay. You have two locations. Mansion with courtyard and END game tanker. All. The gameplay in itself ... is bad\, it is terrible. The weapon is not felt\, you shoot as if from children's farts. You don’t understand whether you hit the enemy or not\, because the damage is not reflected on them. You shoot\, move away\, shoot\, move away; repeat until the end of the game. This is not an interesting gameplay. He's just boring. But they probably tried with the bosses\, right? You ask. No\, they didn’t try. The same thing\, hit with a chainsaw\, step back and repeat\, repeat. All boss battles are just cut scenes\, you just need to wait for the activation of a particular script\, or activate it yourself. Each boss battle: shoot\, move away\, shoot\, script\, passed.But you know\, basically there’s nobody to shoot at. There are some **** demons\, there are only 4 of them. Vomiting\, ordinary\, crawling\, ordinary with a claw. They do not represent danger\, well\, in general\, no. Turn on any complexity and nothing will change. You can run away from them at the door\, they will disappear and go quietly on. Or simply run them. And these very **** demons appear extremely rarely. You simply go to empty locations. As written below\, Resident Evil 7 is simply a Walking Simulator. Walk yourself\, walk.Or in rare cases\, you can be a kind of Rambo\, because you will always have a large number of ammunition\, guns\, etc.\, you can simply shoot all the **** demons. If it’s straight\, it has become so boring at all. And from this\, players have to **** in their pants? Should they be afraid of this?In the same Alien: Isolation\, there is always fear\, even in those moments when you have weapons and you are in a safe room. You will still have reason to be afraid. Namely\, the Alien himself. This is a death machine\, sensitive\, fast and smart. You need to complete the main quest and at the same time think about how to get this creature for dinner. The atmosphere in Alien: Isolation is beautifully served.If Alien: Isolation scares the atmosphere and a smart opponent\, then Outlast scares you with screamers and a shock effect. They cut off your fingers\, try to cut off a member\, you fall into a bunch of corpses and so on. Outlast has an atmosphere\, but it is pushed into the background. There is no constant sense of danger\, as in Alien: Isolation.3. The atmosphere. Resident Evil 7 has no atmosphere and no smart opponents. As I said before\, any opponent can simply be circumvented. They scare you with rare scrimers and that’s it. They are afraid of nobody and nothing. There is no sense of danger. I played at an insane level of difficulty on ps4\, that is\, with a gamepad. (hello all the tanking control of the past parts). And either I'm too brave\, or this game simply can scare only the most impressionable people in the world. Well\, really\, you go to empty locations\, who is there to be scared of?4. Characters. Absolutely no one was remembered. They are all dolls. Not interesting\, not emotional\, not prescribed\, just wooden dolls. One character had a chance to be remembered\, but he was given too little screen time.Conclusion: This is not Resident Evil and will never be. In this game\, everything was done poorly\, sometimes the graphics are beautiful\, but basically everything is gray and ****\, I'm not talking about quality\, I'm talking about the places we go to. Seriously\, there is a whole corridor level where a bunch of gray biomass is just poured around you. I am not kidding. Bosses are boring and monotonous\, the gameplay is terrible and boring.Dark Souls in the first person.… Expand",True,0.5441777110099792,0.5612670183181763,0.4041987359523773,0.6167492270469666,0.7086358070373535,0.4532124102115631,0.41759490966796875,0.6376041769981384,0.5479285717010498

The brevity is forgiven\,Resident Evil 7 firmly re-asserts the franchise at the forefront of horror gaming after a couple of very disappointing games\, taking inspiration from the fantastic Revelations handheld spin-offs and of course\, the classic first installment. The game tries its best to scare you\, unsettle you\, panic you\, and ultimately it is a thrilling experience\, if a little brief. The brevity is forgiven\, as it definitely feels like this game is an experiment\, to play around with new ideas and re-introduce old ones\, as if setting the path for the future. And I loved it.Combat is classically Resident Evil - frantic\, deliberately clunky\, and punishing if you aren't concentrating. This is enhanced by the new first person viewpoint\, piling on intensity to an already overbearing premise. Puzzles are fantastic\, item management is a hark back to the old days\, and the game progression is enjoyable. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous\, in the most disgusting way\, particularly the environments. The Baker mansion and subsequent areas are grimy\, alive\, horrific and claustrophobic. The sound design is also spot-on. Fighting bosses is where the game excels in these areas\, as Jack relentlessly pursues you through the entire house\, or Marguerite stalks you in the yard\, leaving few places to hide and your heart in your throat. General enemies are very...general\, and a bit bland. There isn't a big variety and fighting them becomes a bit stale by the end.The story is OK\, and eventually does link back to the old games in a bit of a tenuous way. A lot is left unexplained but since this is a soft-reboot\, this is fine. DLC will open this game up more\, but it definitely feels like content is missing\, especially in the latter half. The first few hours of this game are among the scariest\, more engrossing in any game I've played\, and I was genuinely shaking after reaching the first save point (which are few and far between). The game is shrouded in mystery\, which I loved\, and has enough twists to make it interesting. But overall\, again\, the length hurts it. Just where\, for example\, Resident Evil 4 is getting into the crux of the plot\, this installment is rounding off. I kind of resent needing DLC to finish an experience\, but I enjoyed this game and will likely get them.RE7 is a true return to form\, getting rid of ridiculous action-horror and stripping everything back to create a raw\, traumatizing and exhilarating gaming experience unlike any other. There's definite room for improvement but in a franchise so convoluted\, plot elements will always sit a little weird\, especially when combined with the realism of this entry.

Presented in a first person perspective\, you play as Ethan\, a man who is trying to find his missing wife\, who sent him a mysterious message\, first telling him not to look for her\, then where to find her.The game starts off very promising – the house is suitably creepy\,Resident Evil 7 is a return to the horror genre from the survival action games that the previous three games had been. Presented in a first person perspective\, you play as Ethan\, a man who is trying to find his missing wife\, who sent him a mysterious message\, first telling him not to look for her\, then where to find her.The game starts off very promising – the house is suitably creepy\, and when you run into the Baker family for the first time\, they’re proper horror game enemies. Completely impossible to kill\, they are implacable and unstoppable\, and all you can do is slow them down and then run and hide. Horrible things happen to the main character\, and there is something fundamentally wrong with his wife\, Mia. Zoe\, who seems to be related to the Bakers in some way\, helps you out over the phone\, and the whole thing seems to be unfolding rather nicely\, as you try to explore a house while being stalked by a man who can’t be stopped and can’t be killed.There are even boss fights against these enemies\, where you use powerful environmental objects to seemingly cause them severe damage and even “kill” them\, but just minutes later they pop back up again and start throwing you around.The problem is\, the game has to move on\, and after that point\, the game stops really working.The reason for this is fairly simple – when you’re early on in the game\, you are weak and helpless. The house is creepy\, the enemies are implacable\, and you don’t know what’s going on. The few “lesser” enemies you face are really tough to take down and take a ton of shots from the pistol to the head to kill.To finally break out of the house\, you get a shotgun and you manage to take down one of the Bakers before you break out. The fight is suitably dramatic – after multiple prior encounters where no matter what you did\, your foe kept on coming back\, here\, you can finally do a good number on him\, and there isn’t the same sense that he’s just going to pop back up again.But at this point\, the Bakers are no longer invulnerable\, and you are better armed and can actually meaningfully fight back. And this pretty much makes the game fall apart\, because now\, you know what’s going to happen – you’re going to creep around for a bit\, there’s going to be a boss fight\, and you’re going to kill them\, and then they’ll come back and you’ll kill them again.So what was originally a really cool horror game turns into a more action oriented game. The enemies are still not something you want to waste ammo on\, but the fact that you know you CAN just take them down makes them feel a lot less menacing – something that stays until a brief section towards the end of the game\, where you are temporarily disarmed again (well\, sort of. It’s complicated). The feeling of helplessness is gone.Worse\, after searching the first house\, the next two areas just feel like rehashes\, where you’re just going up against a different member of the Baker family. The third area does mix up the formula a bit\, but it still ends up following the same structure\, which makes the game feel too predictable\, which undermines the horror.And frankly\, the other two members of the Baker family just aren’t as good at being intimidating as Jack is.The result is something like letting air out of a balloon\, as the game feels like it just gradually deflates\, transitioning more and more into a FPS game as enemies become less and less of a threat – but it still feels a bit janky\, because it was originally a horror game.All in all\, by the end of it\, I was armed to the gills and ready for anything\, and while this served as a bit of catharsis\, it ultimately felt like the game was too long even at only 10 hours in length.It doesn’t help that the protagonists of the game – Ethan and his wife\, Mia – are frankly not very interesting characters. Ethan feels kind of generic\, and often seems to be kind of useless\, and Mia’s character is very vaguely defined for most of the game\, until you get to nearly the end of it. And while Jack Baker is a cool foe\, the other two members of the family aren’t as interesting\, even if a late-game twist tries to fix that.So what are my overall feelings on this game?On the one hand\, the start of the game was really good\, and delivered the horror\, “don’t get caught” feel very well. On the other hand\, the game just kind of goes downhill after you escape the first “real” area of the game.So I’m not sure I can really recommend this. It was interesting to play through for a bit\, but at the end\, I wasn’t terribly invested.… Expand",True,0.8800637125968933,0.9133877754211426,0.8209696412086487,0.9416605234146118,0.9498320817947388,0.7886670827865601,0.6749855279922485,0.9227770566940308,0.8208029270172119

Experiencing survival horror in PSVR gave me the same mindbending sensation that playing the original RE on PlayStation 1 gave me in the 1990s. After turning off all the comfort restrictions and letting myself fully loose in the VR mode\, I was blown away by how immersive\, moody and scary - not to mention intuitive - it felt to play the game in VR. Shooting at enemies using head tracking and navigating dark hallways with tense muscles never felt better. From the control scheme to the pop-up menus\, everything just works unexpectedly smoothly for a first generation VR game. The folks at Capcom have done a great service to the medium of VR games by showing that it can be done without compromises. Sure\, the resolution of the PSVR is noticeably inferior to a 1080p\, let alone a 4K TV\, so the image quality suffers. I wasn't bothered by that all that much. It is more than compensated for by the high framerate and the ability to have terrifying encounters with demonic enemies at close range. There aren't many full-length VR games out there\, so RE7 doesn't have much competition\, but standing on its own merits\, RE7 in VR is an uncompromised experience that can only be described by one word: EPIC. While the medium is still young\, RE7 gives us an exciting and pioneering leap into the unknown future of video gaming.Survival horror redefined!GAME REVIEW: The game was originally marketed as something completely different\, but make no mistake: RE7 happens to be a good\, traditional Resident Evil game. It may not the pinnacle of the series\, but its highs are some of the best in the entire series. The transition from third to first person was unexpected\, but they achieved it very well. Nothing was compromised in the process. All the traditional gameplay mechanics of classic RE games are here\, from herbs to locked doors. The cultish family was an inspired choice for a storyline and the dilapidated setting of the Louisiana mansion fits the franchise perfectly. On the negative side\, it is quite short\, and the last third of the game is rather weak. These drag down an otherwise stellar experience\, but luckily not by much.Overall\, as a RE game\, I give it 8/10. The VR mode alone is 10/10.

So what's wrong with the game? Well\, boss battles are actually forgettable (I found the best one to be versus Marguerite). And to make them forgettable is also the combination of first–person view with the movement system: Ethan is too slow and woody in moving\, turning\, running and in combination with first–person view this is problematic\, even more during boss battles. Also variety of enemies is actually not much. Speaking of \""Madhouse\"" mode: it adds cassette tapes to get obtained and needed to save\, great\, but it should have been like that by default\, also there is never a real shortage of tapes. However\, I did not appreciate too radical changes to everything else in the mode: tougher enemies and weaker Ethan would have been enough\, it wasn't needed to make enemies faster and more aggressive\, which mostly unbalances the game too much.Technically speaking\, the RE Engine is a great graphics engine. Not perfect\, of course\, but it gives the game remarkable visuals and competitive rendering on almost all levels. We know in 2020 that the graphics engine has made its way in other Capcom games. The sound component is no different\, given the importance in a survival horror game.Resident Evil 7 was a gamble. A shocking\, and even a bit desperate\, attempt to renew and refresh a historical saga. I myself was highly skeptical but reviews\, consensus and sales showed that Capcom was right. The result is a great game which lives on many strengths and obvious flaws\, while remains a survival horror experience for both fans of the genre and fans of the saga.… Expand",True,0.7162589430809021,0.797203540802002,0.6601808071136475,0.8761622309684753,0.7095296382904053,0.7342433929443359,0.16006849706172943,0.5583248734474182,0.7480396628379822

I do not like anything horror related because for me it falls into 2 categories. Either it’s not scary and its just a poorly made action movie or it disturbs me on a psychological level and then I’m not able to sleep at night. This game was the latter for me.This game made me more afraid than I have ever been in my entire life. It put me on edge almost immediately and I was on edge for a vast majority of this game. Its the perfect mixture of jump scares\, psychological torment and low points that make are just long enough to make it so you start to feel safe. Once you start feeling just a little comfortable\, bam! The game throws a curve ball.The game starts out with a perfect and classic horror trope. Its just enough to get you hooked and make you want to see a little bit more of the game. The game starts out with your wife (Mia) sending you a video message saying\, how she loves you and she can’t wait to come home from her babysitting trip. Then the game cuts to another video that has her apologizing for lying and then her telling you to stay away. Then the game cuts again to a car and it’s you (the main character) driving and you’re on the phone with some other man. The Ethan (the main character) is talking about how Mia (your wife) just reached out and wants you to come get her. So now you’re on your way to someplace in Louisiana that is in the middle of nowhere. So within the first 2-3 minutes of the game\, you’re wife wants to see you\, doesn’t to see you and then wants to see you. Right off the bat\, what is happening?You end up finding your wife fairly quickly but she’s not overly happy to see you which just adds to the confusion. This is when the game really starts to take the first step to being creepy and disturbing. Your wife is possessed and every other moment she switches from wanting to kill you to loving you. So right after that you’re hit over the head\, knocked out and then you wake up at a dinner table with the Baker family. Who are the main antagonists in the game?I’m not going to go into any more specific detail than that. That’s all within probably the first half hour of the game so I don’t feel like I’m spoiling too much. The rest of the game\, you have the simple goal of getting Mia and yourself out of that house. You do this by solving puzzles\, avoiding the Baker family as best you can and going through these pointless boss battles. The boss battles are probably my biggest complaint about the game\, you can’t kill the Baker family so they’re kind of pointless. Outside of the boss battles and just in the game itself\, it’s very effective because you always feel weak against them.What made this game so scary for me is there is always the thought that something could pop out at any point. They set the tone of this game early on very well because of the tone of the music. At all times it made me feel uneasy and I never felt safe. Unless I was in a specific room which was a “safe” room where you could save your game file\, it was peaceful music and no one in the baker family could enter that room. That room was my decompression room\, anytime I started to panic and get nervous I would make a “B-Line” straight to one of those rooms which are scattered all across the map.The game itself is really split into 7 areas. There is a shack where the initially starts\, the main house (where you wake up)\, an area called the “old house\,” a “game area\,” a boathouse\, a wrecked ship and then a swampy salt mine. Probably 2/3rd’s of the game are in the old house and main house which is the scariest part of the game. The back third is really more of an action/third person shooter that’s a little creepy. What I also liked about the back third was the wrecked ship was the part of the game where almost everything gets answered. So the narrative part of the game had a been building up and presenting all of these questions that are revealed during that part.The game ends with a final boss that isn’t too difficult. If you like horror films and TV shows then this is a must play. There is something about a video game where you’re in control that really ramps up the horror. The fact that the game is in first person rather than third also makes it that much more stressful. This may sound odd but I am very proud of myself for finishing this game. It was very hard for me because it is so scary and so well done. I don’t think I will ever play another horror game but I’m happy I experienced this and powered through.… Expand",True,0.9238235354423523,0.8555856943130493,0.7287580370903015,0.9256885647773743,0.9511662721633911,0.7892957329750061,0.5020785331726074,0.8141065239906311,0.8749277591705322

89988,RE7B,2017-02-01,9.0,"Resident Evil 7: biohazard is a glorious return to survival horror yet it contains dated elements from older games. RE7 is one of my favorite games in the Resident Evil franchise. People claiming this is not a true Resident Evil experience are dead wrong.The game plays like classic Resident Evil games where you are forced to survive biological monsters in a single location. Here you playResident Evil 7: biohazard is a glorious return to survival horror yet it contains dated elements from older games. RE7 is one of my favorite games in the Resident Evil franchise. People claiming this is not a true Resident Evil experience are dead wrong.The game plays like classic Resident Evil games where you are forced to survive biological monsters in a single location. Here you play as Ethan Winters an average Joe who comes to a creepy plantation run by the sinister Baker family in Dulvey Louisiana in search of his missing wife. The story is very simple and not overcomplicated unlike the previous games. New players can play this as this first RE game without having played the previous. The game ends with many unanswered questions and plot holes that I hope will answered in the free DLC coming up. The game tells an overall good simple story that was nothing special.RE7 has gameplay that is great but needs some updating. The game contains save rooms along with item boxes that were used in the early titles of the series. The player can also craft chem fluids to create health kits\, standard ammunition as well as special ammunition throughout the game. I liked the game’s crafting system but found the save rooms not very useful due to implementation of auto saving checkpoints throughout the game. Save rooms were an important part of the franchise’s early history but seems archaic compared to modern horrors games. The exploration is easily the best part of RE7’s gameplay. The game rewards the player for exploration by rewarding them with more story details and playable VHS tapes. The game’s puzzles are well done and simple and do not stop the free flowing nature of the gameplay. Item management is crucial part of surviving the horrors in RE7 and I am happy to see their return here. The boss fights are hit or miss. Some where you would have a one on one encounter with one of the members of the Baker family can be very intense and uncomfortable. I wish that they have scrapped the giant mutant boss fights the game has. These boss fights lack subtlety the rest of the game has and belong in an action game rather than a horror focused title. When the player is not fighting the Bakers the player fights monsters called molded. Ethan is armed with a knife\, pistol\, shotgun\, flamethrower to name a few of the weapons. I found that by the end of the game I was given more weapons than I thought was necessary. I feel that even though it may be a series tradition combat should be dropped in future installments or left only for boss encounters.RE7 has some of the best graphics I have seen in a game. It uses Capcom’s new RE Engine that uses advanced photogrammetry to design detailed characters and environments. The character and monsters are realistic and detailed adding to the scares and immersion. The game’s gore is horrifically detailed and so are the horrifically grimey filled environments. RE7 has some great environments but some are more miss than hit. The beginning of the game which takes place in the guest house is darkly detailed absolutely beautiful in the worse kind of ways looking very photorealistic while the main Baker mansion building looks too colorful or drab at times. The excessive colors make the characters and environment look much faker and take away from the impressive photogrammetry the developers worked so hard on. The game looks its best in dingy and filthy environments but looks less immersive in cleaner\, brightly lit environments which show off the game's graphical flaws. RE7 besides having the visuals down has some great ambient sound effects that help strengthen the game's immersion such as the noise of creaky wood and the gusts of wind outside. Other than a few small technical problems such as texture pop in\, some occasional blurry textures\, and slow load times RE7 is a technical wonder.RE7 features many disturbing violent moments that definitely add to the fear factor but I was not very scared during my playthrough. The Baker Family can be cartoony and ridiculous at times. I found the family members of Jack and Lucas by far the least scary with their goofy over the top accents and cringe worthy one liners they constantly spout. Ironically\, I feel like the game felt too much like a classic RE game at times and wish that they added more elements from newer horror games such as Outlast.Resident Evil 7: biohazard is a great horror game that should be played by all fans of the survival horror genre. RE7 is definitely not a perfect game that suffers from dated gameplay features and concepts from older RE games that take away a bit from the horror. But what the game succeeds in by innovating horror games through its new game engine far outways minor issues the game faces. RE7 has put the series on the right path and is one of the best AAA survival horror games of the current generation.8.5/10: Great… Expand",True,0.7600647211074829,0.8778558969497681,0.6348423361778259,0.8900391459465027,0.8977407217025757,0.7019565105438232,0.5585874319076538,0.8768907785415649,0.7362496852874756

89994,RE7B,2017-02-19,4.0,"I don't know why people put 7 up on such a high pedestal. I can't say I had fun with it. It was really disappointing to me and felt so out of place. It looks and feels more like other franchises and less like its own. There are only a few remnants of Resident Evil in 7\, and the most important and widely popular characteristics are abandoned simply to lure in more players primarily for the VR experience. Just because it's now more horror than action doesn't mean it feels any more like Resident Evil by any stretch of the imagination. People say that if you weren't given the titles of 4-6\, you wouldn't know they were RE games. If you're gonna go with that argument\, then I'll just say that if you weren't given the title of 7\, you would have no idea that it was an RE game. Absolutely none. There's nothing that deems it as such until you read important documents. Sure\, it has item management\, limited resources\, and a few puzzles\, but that's not what makes a Resident Evil game.The atmosphere and horror are completely different. It's more gory than scary. Most of the horror consists of jump scares that only get you if you're off guard. They attack all your senses in a cheap\, lazy way. I feel like they spent more time on the aesthetic and less on the story. The setting has remarkable detail but the story itself lacks many crucial details. The type of horror in the previous Resident Evils is convincing. It attacks all your senses in such a way that even the music makes you feel vulnerable. Makes your skin crawl without the presence of a malevolent being. You just know your impending doom. Not once did I feel this way in 7. You didn't have many chances to just be by yourself. There was always a Baker all up in your grill. Not to mention they're **** INVINCIBLE. I'm not a fan of feeling completely powerless in a video game. I want to feel like I have the upper hand at least sometimes. After all\, it is SURVIVAL horror. How do you survive against literally indestructible beings? Don't worry\, it's all scripted anyway. They **** off after a while. The only time you feel like you have the upper hand is when you face the molded\, the most unoriginal\, least scary creatures I've ever seen in a Resident Evil game.An argument I'm sick of hearing: \""RE was initially intended to be first person\,\"" I'm well aware. But the fact is\, it wasn't first person. It was fixed camera\, and I'm glad it was. We got what we got\, and fans have familiarized themselves with it for years. It's not about what could have been or what was originally intended\, it's about what was actually delivered to us in the end that counts. And we ate it up. First person was only utilized a few times. And in those instances\, they were never successful and easily forgotten. I can see why this one would be successful no doubt\, because they made it work better than the other times they've tried it\, but it hardly feels part of the RE universe anymore. A game can't abandon all established characteristics and still remain part of a franchise. It doesn't work like that. That's when it becomes something new entirely. That's why Devil May Cry is a thing.RE doesn't need to have original characters to be an RE game\, but look at the ones that didn't have original characters and weren't part of the main series. Like Dead Aim and Outbreak. Swept under the carpet and easily forgotten. Barely part of the lore\, but still titled as RE games. I feel like if 7 hadn't been an addition to the main story and didn't have a returning character\,  it would be swept under the carpet with the rest. Not like any of the characters are particularly interesting up until that point anyway. They are if you enjoy horror tropes. Literally. Just horror movie cliches and blatant rip-offs. Anyway\, I can respect the audience that 7 drew in\, because I know a lot of people dig this type of **** but I do not.

The honest answer is HYPE.This game has been hyped as the best Resident Evil game of the past decade\, returning to their origins of puzzles and horror survival\, ditching the FPS feel of RE5. I took the scary factor of the game as a challenge and only played the game when the sun had gone down and the lights had been turned off. Brightness was set to the correct low level and the volume was turned up.GraphicsOverall the graphics are incredible\, which they should be since a majority of the time your environment is static so all rendering power can be dedicated to the environment. The only moments when I felt the graphics were sub par are when antagonists faces are pressed up very close to your own. Other than that the graphics are very high quality.AudioAudio is incredibly important in a mostly quiet horror game like this. Things are constantly going bump in the night making you look over your shoulder. Did someone just knock on that door? What was that creak? The audio is 80% of the scary factor in this game.GameplayThe game takes place in a bijou in **** Louisiana. Most of your time is spent in old destitute houses and the surrounding property with monsters and no shortage of body parts.The controls are very intuitive and natural\, so much so that there's not much to talk about! You're in control. My only gripe is that R1 instantly uses any healing medicine you have\, and to craft an item you open you inventory with Triangle\, and then press R1. Needless to say more often than I care to admit I accidentally used a healing solution when really I meant to craft an item. This usually ended with me stopping the game and going back to my last save point\, see below!I must have been saving every 10 minutes. You save your progress in little \""safe\"" rooms that also usually include a chest to store your items since on-person storage is limited. These safe rooms are surprisingly plentiful and strategically located\, but that didn't stop me from saving constantly just in case (just in case I'm an idiot who keeps wasting his healing solutions).Shoot for the head or run and hide! Ammo and health are not as limited as other games in the horror survival genre\, but that doesn't give you the go ahead to be loosey goosey with your booger hook on the bang switch either. There are items hidden everywhere that you can collect and combine together to craft usable items like health or ammo.The puzzles are sometimes difficult\, but not impossible. The games gives you a look into the future with the video tapes you find. When you watch a video tape you get to experience the environment you are about to go into in the \""real\"" game which can be very useful if you pay attention.ConclusionResident Evil 7: Biohazard is a very entertaining horror survival game that is hard to put down. Is it worth the price for only 8 hours of gameplay with little replay value? That's your decision. Is the game fun and satisfying to complete? Absolutely.… Expand",True,0.8072207570075989,0.7345009446144104,0.883294939994812,0.867220401763916,0.7341580986976624,0.7872587442398071,0.8201153874397278,0.8407456874847412,0.8475945591926575

For so long it seems the series was in a nose dive spinning further and further away from its horror roots\, and turning into an almost sometimes off-putting action shooter. RE7 is a welcoming throwback to the golden age of gaming and a return to what many old fans would agree is what made Resident Evil so amazing\, to begin with. Although the FPS is a new take on the series it's a surprisingly pleasing addition that emphasizes the overall terrifying environment around you. I thoroughly enjoyed the Baker family mystery. When I was not on the edge of my seat in terror\, I found myself wrapped up in trying to figure out what happened to make this disturbing family become what the have.  On a mechanical level\, the games runs very smooth and offers a wide range of weapons more satisfying than the last. The overall graphics are stunning and utilize the full power of the PS4 which (is in my opinion) one of the best-looking games on the console to date. My only complaints derive from nitpicking put I will state them anyhow\, personally\, I would have liked to seen more intricate or at least more unique boss fights\, and the DLC left something to be desired. It wasn't bad by any means\, just not worth the $9.99 I paid to play. The first DLC batch comes off as mini games they could have thrown into the main game or at least should have offered after beating the main storyline\, much like in other RE installments that gave us The Mercenaries\, and Assignment Ada mini games upon completion. With all of that being said\, the good far outweighs the bad elements and RE7 puts itself near the top of the best in the series. Now\, all we can hope for is that Capcom continues making Resident Evil the way it was always meant to be played\, a true survival horror experience. ~ieatplants… Expand",True,0.275464802980423,0.24489182233810425,0.25838565826416016,0.8690049052238464,0.8202486634254456,0.38191017508506775,0.30844995379447937,0.766275942325592,0.6411166787147522

How can these \""critics\"" sleep at night\, knowing that they have given such misinformation to consumers? SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!This game is 6/10 at most and heres why its only that\, without any fanboyism or bias added:-First of all\, this game is not scary\, unless you use VR and see the hideous face models of the NPCs up in your face\, which seems to be their sole way of trying to scare you. This game is nothing compared to Outlast or even Alien: Isolation.-Its extremely scripted to the point that it destroys all replay value and its even less scary in future playthroughs\, if for some reason you have nothing better to do...-There are only a few varieties of a single enemy type with just a few attack patterns. And also\, you can just skip these said enemies all together by just running past them\, removing all danger they pose as they become more of an annoyance than a threat after a while. They cant even go through doors for **** sake...-The item management is abysmal and taken too far\, you will be spending more time playing Tetris with your inventory or backtracking to a safe house to throw your junk away\, than being terrified. Like really?-The movement and gun play is slow and sluggish\, and possibly made intentionally to not make VR users throw up. It almost feels like tank controls in first person...-Theres only a few boss fights and oh... my... god\, that last boss fight is just terribad\, never have i seen such a bad boss encounter. Its even worse than Ndesu in RE5 if you can believe it...-The graphics are above average at best\, the level design is great due to the small areas but the textures on all the clutter can be downright fugly. Photorealistic like advertised? Nope.-The game is short\, clocking from 5-8 hours on the first run\, and the two endings are so extremely similar to each other that theres NO point doing a replay\, especially since everything is scripted. The game banks on you replaying its short story over and over and over again without any incentive for you to do so. Sure\, Madhouse mode adds few changes in there\, such as limited saves\, but its still the same game in the core. And predictable.-The game is SP only\, not even Co-op of any sort included.-This game has almost nothing to do with Resident Evil\, its a VR tech demo with Resident Evil stamped on it. Kawata said they were going to go back to the \""roots\"" of RE\, well this is not it. Just because they slapped inventory management or herbs in there\, doesnt make it a Resident Evil game.-And ofc... the DLC practices are **** as usual(Capcom man...)\, cutting up the game and serving it to us for 10€ a piece after a week is simply not acceptable\, especially since the game is so short and desperately needed new modes or missions. These sort of game modes used to be given to us for free after beating the original game. Remember Mercenaries? Now thats called Nightmare except its worse than Mercenaries and it costs 10 bucks thank you very much! Corporate commander thanks you.Also as a side note... Wtf is up with the story? Its full of holes and loose ends near the end that make no sense and never get answered\, almost like it was just pushed out quick to meet a deadline. Lets be real here\, they are probably just saving all that for DLC because... more money?I could just go on and on and on\, this game makes no sense on so many levels...Anyway... the game is not worth 60€$£ at all\, at best it shouldve been 30-40. It almost feels like it was going to be 40 but the suits said \""Oh yea its in VR...add another 20 in there\""\, lets call it a... VR tax.Wait till its on sale and then get it when it has more content and value for your money.I get that RE fans have been waiting for a better RE game since 4... but this game is NOT the masterpiece some people make it out to be\, its above average game at best. Dont trust those sources that tell you this game is anything above 7/10 because its not\, those people let their fanboyism blind their judgement.Either that\, or they just have insanely low standards and are just not trustworthy at all.If this review saves at least one persons hard earned money then iam happy\, spend it on something you enjoy longer and has more bang for your buck than this mediocre Haunted House 7: The Item Management game.… Expand",True,0.21234504878520966,0.48755118250846863,0.1437276154756546,0.23827213048934937,0.335915744304657,0.14037278294563293,0.22046655416488647,0.21857985854148865,0.5752441883087158

The first person view can be seen as an updated versionSay what you will about Resident Evil 7\, but there is not a single person who has touched this game that can deny that much love and care went into crafting this unsettling horror adventure. RE7 manages to capture the key elements that made the originals such monumental classics\, albeit in a much less cheesy and more modern fashion. The first person view can be seen as an updated version of the original's forced perspective\, keeping whatever lurks around the corner hidden until it rears it's (very) ugly head. The bulk of the gameplay is very similar to the original Resident Evil; confronting or avoiding enemies\, collecting keys and other items to unlock rooms and doors\, as well as collecting documents to uncover more of the backstory behind the decrepit Baker Estate. However\, RE7 doesn't just copy and paste what made it's predecessors a success\, it makes them it's own by adding a new spin\, replacing some documents with interactive video tapes that often reveal key details of what you need to do at certain points in the game\, and then there are the Bakers themselves which function like an updated version of Nemesis from Resident Evil 3\, they can be momentarily knocked out\, but for the most part that can't be killed. 'That gun ain't gonna work they way you think it will'.Still\, RE7 is not without it's flaws. The boss battles\, while spectacular and engaging at first\, can often get annoying when you have to repeat them multiple times until you figure out the trick to besting the enemy\, and while the Bakers are very well designed in how they act/re-act\, the lesser enemies in the game feel stupid by comparison\, often letting you run straight past them\, making them virtually harmless unless you get yourself cornered or play on the madhouse difficulty which is generally unlocked post-game unless you nabbed the pre-order bonus survival kit which unlocks the increased difficulty early.Overall\, Resident Evil 7 is a phenomenal horror game and\, even better\, a fantastic Resident Evil game\, which is something that we have been waiting for in the mainline series for quite some time. While RE4 and 5 were fantastic action/horror games in their own right\, they lacked the heart and soul of the original core games that made them such a hit with the original fans that have stuck around since the 90s. I sincerely hope that Capcom uses RE7 as a mold (no pun intended) for future installments of the series\, perhaps continuing the RE4/5 style of gameplay within the Revelations sub-series because\, lets be honest\, the co-op in RE5 and Revelations 2 was bloody fun! RE6 even had it's moments.Please\, do not listen to the reviews giving this game obnoxiously low scores\, because I guarantee that more than half of them have not played the game. Look up gameplay (but not too much\, the mystery is half the fun!) and listen to people that you know for a fact have played the game\, and then make the choice for yourself.… Expand",True,0.30339452624320984,0.40081652998924255,0.32948291301727295,0.5415211319923401,0.26637837290763855,0.5581210851669312,0.20674565434455872,0.35330191254615784,0.47722139954566956

The mansion and houses all have a unique feel and look gritty and horrifying. The game-play is similar to the early games and rewards exploration. The story is good although not mind-blowing it still has an interesting narrative that will satisfy until the end of game.The VHS levels are a unique twist and offer some variation in game-play. 'Happy Birthday' is the stand out tape and reminds me of the film SAW.Sound and music help to create the atmosphere well. With more sinister tracks playing when you about to encounter something dreadful and the traditional calming track when you finally find that safe room!Combat works well and the bosses you encounter are all varied and interesting.I preferred the first part of the game been staled around the mansion by the Baker family\, this part of the game reminded me a lot of Texas Chainsaw The fear is much more intense knowing you cant kill any of the grotesque Baker family until you enter their boss arena. The other enemy type are The Molded\, beasts that look like they are made of dripping black mold or tar. At first they are scary but after slaying a few they lose their impact. There are variations of them but a few more monster types would have kept the game fresh all the way through.Two DLCs are out at the time of writing.

I've yet to play them so they wont affect my score.I would recommend Resident Evil 7 to past fans and new players.

You will feel rewarded after killing each enemy\, and the atmosphere is amazing. The level design is not the best\, but it is very well designed\, the swamp\, the houses and the trailer\, all scary places and there is some good vibe about the scenarios. The graphics are good enough and the sound will make you insecure and scared\, like there's somethin lurking in the darkness. The gameplay could have been designed better\,but you really feel rewarded for your good aim\, and most (if not all) enemies have a weak point\, and you will find that some weapons work better against certain enemies\, that right there is clever design. Puzzles are present and most of them are kind of easy to figure out but still very funny and you have to think and reason the solutions. The inventory design should have been like the classic resident evil games\, but this inventory is in real time\, wich I disliked the idea at first\, but being honest it would be much easier if the inventory wasn't in real time. The key objects are very interesting and you can notice that they put effort in designing the doors\, the objects and even the objects that you can watch but can't pick up. The whole world in resident evil 7 is worth looking at and you will feel rewarded for exploring each place. There are clues that guide you where to find some items or how to solve puzzles\, and some other files will tell you the story of the game\, wich is interesting but it could have been much better\, like using better characters and using places related to umbrella or some kind of lab\, but it's still a very good plot that has nothing to do with previous resident evil games\, wich is very dissapointing.Finally\, this game is funny\, scary and immersive\, The ammo and healing items are very limited and you should use them wisely\, that's what I call survival horror\, Hope the next entry in the series will return to 3rd person and add some more creepy music to the game.Beware of long loading times\, that is not a good thing\, thankfully you don't have to wait much between cutscenes.I give this game a 6.4\, which is closer to 6 than 7\, and if you are wondering if it is worth buying\, let me tell you that you won't be dissapointed. Resident evil series is not dead yet.Good:+ Good atmosphere and creepy places+ Cleverly designed puzzles+ This game is not hard at all\, the difficulty is just normal+ Nice graphics and audio+ Good artwork and objects design+ True survival horror elements\, very limited resources and rewarding exploration+ Plenty ammount of resources to be found\, but they are still limited because some enemies take too much bullets to die.Bad:- Repetitive enemies and tedious gameplay (sometimes)- Awful boss fights (not all of them)- Confusing plot and uninteresting characters- Main character is too weak and has terrible voice acting.- Overpowered enemies and bosses\, they take too many shots to die but they are still easy and predictable.- Unrealistic and cliche moments\, like shooting that old man and he don't even react to the bullets\, or like when you plug your leg back just with some liquid.- Terrible designed madhouse mode\, wich only exposes the gameplay flaws of this game\, this game does not have much replay value after all.6/10… Expand",True,0.7757631540298462,0.7632670998573303,0.7183336615562439,0.7951067090034485,0.8291301727294922,0.5547531843185425,0.6006201505661011,0.7572294473648071,0.8157687187194824

In fact\, I'd definitely say this is the scariest Resident Evil game that has been made.While I've seen a lot of negative reviews harp on the first person mode being too big a departure for them\, I'd say it actually helps the series quite a bit over the third person mode. It feels more fresh & it definitely makes the experience a lot scarier. The Baker's are an absolutely awesome enemy but one of the reasons I'd give this a 9.5 instead of a 10\, is that I wish there was more enemy variety. The molded are cool and all\, but they do get old after awhile and there are only 4 different types of Molded so you learn their ins and outs pretty quickly. Even adding one or two more enemy types would have been very welcome.The enemy types are probably my biggest complaint over all but in the grand scheme of things\, it didn't affect my enjoyment of the playthrough that drastically.

Now that the suppose 7 is going back to its roots on horror\, does it deliver that chilling suspense and fear that the original RE games didResident Evil has had its problems throughout the several years(with the exception of Revelations 2) in which the the franchise was going in for more of an action series rather than horror that the series thrived on the early years of its premiere. Now that the suppose 7 is going back to its roots on horror\, does it deliver that chilling suspense and fear that the original RE games did before it went full gear on action or does it surmise into the depths of darkness in being one of the forgotten games in recent memory?Story- After 4 years in the events of Resident Evil 6\, you play as Ethan Winters. A new protagonist in search of his wife Mia who has disappeared for 3 years\, leaving Ethan a message saying that he should stay away from her. Ignoring the message\, he located the source of the message\, Louisiana. I thought the story flowed at a good enough pace to keep the player intrigued through the 8-10 hours it takes to play through the game. The writing is spot on and the voice actors do an amazing job of  making the game feel more alive compared to the past Installments of the franchise. The few things that hold the story being any better is that the Resident Evil Mythos is almost non-existent until the very end.Graphics- Capcom has integrated a new RE engine that uses photorealism technology\, giving a more rural detail area that gives a new life to the franchise. On the PS4\, the game runs smoothly with a 60 fps and at times the game can look amazing with the use of lighting on certain parts of the game. The atmosphere of the game is amazing with the whole game having a darker mood  to it and a dreary feel that emits a sense of claustrophobia that makes the player feel incredibly secluded in tight areas. The design of the enemies in the game was design well enough with character models being absolutely fantastic with such clear design and texture\, giving life to the Baker family and the other families in the game\, which gives a Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibe from how they act. The other enemies called the Molded are design fairly well but with only a few varied monsters to kill in the game\, they become more of a nuisance to kill compared to the other monsters the players had faced in the past.Gameplay-By recreating the Resident Evil's \""horror roots\"" \, they change the games perspective into being 1st person rather than it being 3rd person but by doing this\, it makes the whole game even more less of it being Resident Evil and more like Outlast with guns. The player are given types of different guns\, secret caches\, a vendor antique system\, and the return of emblem doors. The aiming of the game is surprisingly well given it being a survival horror game. What's exhilarating about the First Person perspective is the VR option. The player can play the whole game in VR which immerses the player even more and also making the aiming of the game even more accurate. Through the end though\, the game focused too much on combat as tons of molded just complie together against the player and the last boss wasn't even a damn boss. The part that is survival is so minimum that the only time you can call it really survival is when the first Baker family member goes on full frontal assault as the first part of the game\, the player is forced on heavily scripted events in the game\, making the player think that using their weapons and items are in good use except it's not.Overall- The game took me 7-8 hours to beat which is fine for it's length but for some reason I thought the game overstayed its welcome as the end became horde mode and the \""final boss\"" being a disappointment\, but being that\, the first 75% of the game is well thought out. Good atmosphere\, intriguing opening and idea of the whole game\, and well-made psychopath characters. The gameplay can be more desired but I had a fine experience playing through the whole game. I'd say wait for a price drop around 30.

Since that game\, the resi series has been going down hill quite rapidly.  Resi 5 was good but not great and resi 6 was just a disaster.  When resi 7 was announced I loved the idea of it going back to its roots and was praying that the fear factor wasn't being over hyped and that it wouldn't be a let down like the previous 2 games.  Thankfully I had no need to worry\,  One of the best survival horror games out there.Before I get into my review\, I am mainly talking about the VR version.  i have played the entirety of the game in vr and played tiny portions of it on the TV just to see what the difference is.  On an ordinary TV this game is great\, so if you do not have a PSVR set the game is still great.  However if you have a PSVR then quite honestly there is no other way to experience this game.  The immersion and fear is quadrupled in VR it is spine chillingly brilliant.  Obviously the graphics take a hit from how they appear on the TV but this never ever becomes an issue as actually feeling like you are inside this world is far better than having great graphics on the TV.  Besides the graphics in VR are mostly very impressive besides outside which in all honesty can look quite poor at times.  Just as an example of how much difference VR makes I tried a small part of the game on the TV and then after played the same bit in VR.  I was walking into a room and dolls that were hanging on the ceiling dropped to the floor\, on the TV I hardly even noticed and carried on moving forward.  I played in VR and when the dolls dropped I literally jumped out of my own skin\, because when things like that happen\, just for that one second you actually believe that you are truly there.There are some criticisms of the VR mode that come to mind but none of these really detract from the game.  The biggest issue I have which is also a big issue I have with many other vr games is that you only have disembodied hands and no arms I find this takes you out of the experience a little bit\, although you do get used to it pretty quickly.  I just wish developers could find a way to give you arms.  There is also a very small part in the game where you get stabbed in the belly (this is not a spoiler) and when you look down you can see that you have no body and can just see the pen which you were stabbed with is basically floating in midair.  The only other slight negative is that cutscenes are not in vr but appear on a large cinematic screen instead.Now for the game play.  This is survival horror at its best you really do have to take care of the amount of resources you use up and think carefully about what you should bring with you and what you should keep in your storage box.  Running low on ammo really ups the tension and makes you have to use stealth to the best of your ability.  There are some genuinely good scares in this game too\, both from the jump scares to genuine freakiness.  What also adds to the tension is the fact that you don't always know where to go making you feel lost in a good way.I truly can't recommend this game enough!… Expand",True,0.3308400511741638,0.9246102571487427,0.6146414875984192,0.9633122682571411,0.8737838864326477,0.8759889006614685,0.7866104245185852,0.7224487066268921,0.19418838620185852

Does this installment live up to its origins or does it feel more like an action game?Story: In Resident Evil 7: Biohazard you play a character named Ethan who goes searching for his missing wife Mia; she has been missing for three years in Louisiana. Upon your arrival in Louisiana\, you encounter a psychotic family named the Bakers\, but there is a dark secret behind their driven madness. Your goal is to save Mia and escape the Baker mansion.Gameplay: Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is a first person psychological survival horror game. You go around exploring the Baker mansion and the grounds\, collecting items like antique coins\, keys for certain doors\, exploring puzzles\, and fighting off the molded (enemy type) with weapons from handguns to grenade launchers. This is the only the beginning of the game; you never know what is going to be around the corner. Filled with many jump scares and psychological horror\, you will beg for the game to be over. Each baker family member is a boss fight but they are not too difficult which is nice\, and as you get farther into the game you dig deeper into finding out what is behind their madness\, discovering that things are not always what they seem.Conclusion:  Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers a punch when it comes to the horror; from the classic feel of a messed up house\, things moving around and hearing sounds\, the puzzles\, finding hidden rooms where someone may be kept prisoner\, in no way does this game fall short. It is worth the eight hours of your time.Resident Evil 7 Biohazard: 9/10Good Job Capcom.To rent or buy Resident Evil 7: Biohazard\, go to gameaccess.ca… Expand",True,0.4914631247520447,0.55858314037323,0.3667765259742737,0.9527187347412109,0.662743091583252,0.8332379460334778,0.5717686414718628,0.8225046992301941,0.7378527522087097

I feel like I'm exploring Spencer Mansion again except in a big plantation setting.So far\, the puzzles are pretty fun and though some may seem simple\, make the player feel smart.The atmosphere is incredibly well-done\, and returning fans will be glad to see that the horror feeling of the original games has been reestablished quite nicely here. Although there are a few jump scares\, it feels like they are done in the same vein as the original games\, where due to fixed perspective\, you may not see an enemy that's near you try to lunge or grab at you. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in my eyes\, seeing as how that's how the games have always been\, however\, besides this there's another thing that manages to keep you on your toes.The enemy encounters are really well-done\, you could be expedient and take them out with a few headshots\, or you could hack at their limbs to slow them and make a quick escape. You're basically stressed out the entire time because the game makes you quickly aware of how dangerous getting hit by one of these various monstrosities could be\, it's a good feeling though\, not a frustrating one that makes the game feel unfair.The only parts that aren't too well done seem to be the bosses\, some of them (won't mention which) have that classic campy/cheesy RE feel\, but they are few and far between among the fun exploring and puzzle solving so it doesn't weigh down on the experience as much as one would expect.I definitely recommend this game\, to new fans and old ones as well.… Expand",True,0.35696253180503845,0.39239320158958435,0.44553568959236145,0.7863379120826721,0.4757167398929596,0.5994120240211487,0.42279839515686035,0.6721897721290588,0.28718796372413635
90307,RE7B,2017-01-24,10.0,Capcom thank you so much for bringing Resident Evil back to me! I've missed you so much. This is the best Resident Evil since 1 and 2. I love this game!

90308,RE7B,2017-01-24,8.0,"It has been quite some time since I've looked forward to a new Resident Evil game. But there was something about 7 which had caught my eye. Perhaps it was the sudden shift in tone and viewpoint\, or maybe the quirkiness of its villains.

But there was something about 7 which had caught my eye. Perhaps it was the sudden shift in tone and viewpoint\, or maybe the quirkiness of its villains. But one thing that I had definitely noticed was a comeback to the world of survival horror.Resident Evil 7\, in my honest opinion\, is a much needed breath of fresh air for the franchise\, after having living in the shadow of it's fourth installment. Gone are bombastic action sequences which would potentially make Michael Bay envious. Gone are the quick time events which had become so prevalent in the series. Instead\, we are provided with the filthy horrors which lurk within the Baker Plantation.The shift in view point has proven to be quite divisive amongst fans of the franchise. Some scoff at it with pure hatred\, and others praise it for bringing something new to the table. I have to say I'm in the middle of the spectrum. I am interested as to what Capcom has planned for the next main installment\, and hope they refine the first person controls (if they continue on with it.).Gameplay is ripped straight out of classic Resident Evil titles\, with numerous puzzles and some enemy encounters which will make one quite tense. Ammo is scarce\, and you have to pick your battles wisely\, or wind up some creatures next meal. Save rooms return\, as do item boxes and an upgrade system. These provide a moment to catch your breath and decide what your next move should be.Replayability is an issue I see sprouting up frequently. The game has three difficulty modes one can go through\, with the third being unlockable. Trophies are there for whoever wants them. Hidden figurines populate the plantation\, which beckon to be destroyed. There are bonuses for beating the game under certain requirements\, such as new weaponry and infinite ammo. However\, all you'll be getting is the story mode\, with extra game modes and story episodes as dlc in the nearby future.The story for the game doesn't bring anything new to the table. Rather\, it chooses to play it simple snd safe. After Resident Evil 5 & 6\, this was a great pallet cleanser. The story isn't bogged down by lore set by its predecessors\, making 7 an excellent entry point for new comers. However\, that isn't to say there aren't certain things sprinkled in to cater to veteran fans of the series.All in all\, Resident Evil 7 is a gem of a game. Fans of old school Resident Evil will feel right at home\, and newer players will be able to jump right in. It is not without its faults\, such as questionable sound design for some circumstances\, and lack of extra modes. However\, there is plenty to enjoy in the molding corridors of the Baker Estate.… Expand",True,0.4361617863178253,0.21397019922733307,0.2782263457775116,0.8659527897834778,0.6824916005134583,0.5918557643890381,0.5808574557304382,0.7154005169868469,0.620690107345581

It has elements that are very reminiscent of RE1 in the puzzles and mechanics of the game.2. Item progression is good and feels satisfying\, getting that shotgun feels just as enjoyable as it did in RE1 and it steadily inclines as the game progresses.3. Exploration is interesting and worthwhile most of the time\, even if a little fruitless in some areas.4. Boss fights are fun\, with elements similar to RE4 in that you will have a few tactics available to you during them outside of just shooting the weakspot.5. Horror is strong\, especially in the earlier half of the game\, from a strong introduction all the way up until just after the 3rd boss fight\, offering both suspenseful and gore-fest style moments in a nice balance.6. Story is intriguing and you want to know more  almost the whole way through.Cons:1. Enemy variety is lackluster outside of the Boss characters\, the basic enemy is quite dull and uninspiring and although having 3-4 variants\, it still\, visually is almost entirely the same\, which makes them sadly quite dull after about the halfway point.2. While elements of the older games are definitely present\, alot of the charm and presence of mansion and police station from earlier games just isn't replicated\, making alot of rooms\, while well designed\, far less memorable or pleasing\, partly due to the look of the game being somewhat washed out and dreary the whole way through.3. Characters\, while most are good and somewhat memorable for various reasons\, it's sadly the main character and main villain who end up being the weakest and least interesting. Partly a pitfall of being entirely in first person.4. The world pulls you in and keeps you guessing and wanting to discover more and more\, however the payoff is never quite good enough\, with parts of the story being deliberately vague and rushed just for the sake of making you buy dlc as well having almost nothing to do with the resident evil universe for most of the game.(Spoiler territory I'll mark when I'm no longer talking about it)5. The ending. The ending to this game is a horrible let down for a few reasons\, completely skipping out one of the main antagonists without really addressing why and then rushing straight to the end with only the occasional text file to fill in some of the many blanks.But the two biggest let down's are the final boss and the laughable attempt to link to RE universe. The final boss fight is nothing but  a scripted 2 minute fight with unsatisfactory pay off in regards to the design of the monster and the means with which you quickly kill it.6. The name Resident Evil on the box is pretty much all there is for anyone who likes the series as far as story or characters is concerned. This game could have been called anything and it wouldn't have changed a single thing but they chose to use the RE name and sadly it's just nothing to do with it. The rare 1 line of text or random photo is about all you get here.The cameo of a character at the end and the arrival of umbrella is completely cringe worthy as far as how forced in it feels\, especially with the character looking and sounding nothing like their self in other RE games and their motives along with Umbrella's being completely skewed in incredibly unlikely way.Also the fact that they almost entirely ript off the premise for F.E.A.R's story is incredibly lazy.(Spoilers Over)In conclusion this game is a good horror game and worth playing through for anyone who enjoys horror of both the suspenseful kind or the grotesque. But for RE fans looking for the next chapter in their favorite character's story lines it fails completely to deliver\, with almost no connection to the RE universe outside of very limited easter-eggs.CAPCOM's attempt to sell the game in parts\, by tearing out key story elements\, essentially butchering the final act of the game to sell it as DLC is likely the cause for the state that it's in and is kind of saddening to see go the way it did.This didn't need to be a Resident Evil game and it pretty much isn't\, in the same way if they made a new super mario game\, but you didn't play as anyone from any Mario game and the only reference to Mario in it was that you could jump\, run and see the occasional picture of previous mario games on the wall.It's a good horror game\, worth buying\, but it's not a Resident evil game.… Expand",True,0.8240942358970642,0.8937320113182068,0.5093502402305603,0.8653421401977539,0.8480864763259888,0.8211517930030823,0.4587022066116333,0.8410022854804993,0.8576222658157349

The series has seen its highs\, namely RE2\, RE3\, RE4\, and of course the REmaster of the original. And it's certainly seen its fair share of lows including RE6\, Operation Raccoon City\, and Umbrella Corps. The series best known forResident Evil VII: Biohazard First ImpressionsAs some of you may know I am huge fan of the Resident Evil Series and have been since inception circa 1996. The series has seen its highs\, namely RE2\, RE3\, RE4\, and of course the REmaster of the original. And it's certainly seen its fair share of lows including RE6\, Operation Raccoon City\, and Umbrella Corps. The series best known for survival horror had devolved over time and eventually became a Michael Bay 3rd person COD game with terrible mechanics and an even worse story.Fast forward to the present. This week REVII launched with High anxiety and low expectations from RE fans across the world. Capcom announced the \""reboot\"" of the series shortly after that failed RE6 release. And until recently much of REVII remained a mystery. Once revealed the reaction from fans was extremely varied and most would say underwhelming and disappointing.For those who have not yet played the final release\, I am happy to report that RE is back\, and in a BIG way! Now sure\, the core series characters we've come to love may not be present in this latest release. And quite frankly\, that's the best part! Our hero's from yesteryear were battle tested and have seen it all. Tyrants\, Nemesis\, Mr. X\, ZOMBIES\, lickers\, granados\, and the list goes on. Our new protagonist is shaken\, vulnerable\, unsure\, and scared to death. Which is a great way to describe my first 4 hours into the game...lolMan\, did I mention that the Baker family is nuts?!?! Set in the Louisiana bayou\, the game begins and carries a level of mystery and tension that can be cut with a knife.  You are immediately thrust into the fight with little or nothing to go on other than you are searching for your wife that was thought to be missing or dead for the last 3 years. The enviorments are dripping with detail and mystery. And the characters immediately begin to capture your eye and imagination. What happened to this family and how did we end up here?Weapons are limited and ammo is sparse. Initially the enviorments are tight\, and eventually open up. Classic nods to the series including door specific keys\, herbs\, save rooms\,  puzzles ( wish there were more )\, and strategic  boss fights await. The graphics are great and the sounds...well let's just say...the enviorments are the shining star of this sequel. They create a surreal atmosphere ripped straight from the pages of classic horror films while still creating an identity all its own.While it's not perfect\, I must say I am completely infatuated with the game and I am looking forward to uncovering the mysteries of the Baker family plantation. I love the depth and thought put into the characters\, and can appreciate the fantastic level design and crafting mechanic.This game is not for everyone. But for those looking for a classic survival horror experience that may leave a seat cushion or two damp...this one's for you.In addition:Not without its faults. While puzzles have returned\, they are a bit too easy and predictable. And the same can be said for the new enemies \""the molded\"". A higher level or difficulty and more intricate puzzles would have been welcome. And more varied enemies are needed. However we can look forward to 3 additional pieces of DLC starting to hit as soon as next week. 2 new tapes\, and 1 full story add on. I am hopeful Capcom will address some of these issues. With that said\, I believe they are most certainly on the right track and dare I say the road to redemption with the RE franchise.… Expand",True,0.8495021462440491,0.8561937212944031,0.683397650718689,0.9261159896850586,0.8496827483177185,0.9034057259559631,0.8004980087280273,0.8054875731468201,0.843575656414032

Many think that the game taking place in first person would be a bad idea\, but it made things better. Makes combat frantic\, intense and feels like you are the character.4) Combat is fun and satisfying to see enemies hold scars\, gnashes and cuts and still come at you. Using the inventory and seeing the old school heart monitor bar is fitting and feels like fanservice done well.Cons:1) VR is terrible. Not so much the graphics or anything\, but it was so hard to play with a PSVR headset on that I felt like vomiting and had a migraine from just 15 minutes of it on. A dealbreaker to get a VR personally.2) Story is awful.  I am well aware Resident Evil is not a Shakespeare of writing (never has) but at least RE4 had self-awareness and its characters were far more likeable (in a so bad its good attitude). The story has massive plot holes and uses pointless plot contrivances that makes it seem well-connected\, but is rushed out of the gate instead. Ethan Winters is no Leon \""Bingo?\"" Kennedy and his reactions and responses are so unrealistic I laughed my ass off when the situation was very serious.3) Enemy and Boss variety is lacking. When Resident Evil first came out\, we got to fight zombies\, hunters\, dogs\, sharks\, snakes\, and all sorts of creatures to survive. RE4 had ganados\, regenerators\, novistadors\, garridors\, el gigante\, wolves and more. RE7 has only three types of enemies (Mold zombies\, mold 'lickers' and mold pukers) with also a another type of enemy\, but that type is only relevant in one area and no where else in the game. The bosses are lame (aside from the first and second fight with Jack) and offer no real horror or tension. More annoyance than anything. In fact one boss is a series of tests (who you never kill or even see again) than an actual boss to fight. The final boss is a joke and is nothing to Tyrant\, Saddler or Nemesis.4) Post Game Content is weak. You only get the story and that's it. There is no NG+ at all. You can rerun things on different playthroughs (say speedrun\, not dying\, not saving\, etc.) but the game will last (between the two runs I did) in seven hours average. Having no mercenaries\, raid\, separate ways or anything is really shameful when you consider that Capcom wants to sell a season pass on top of a full retailed game and basically contain all the content that this game needs to make it worth it.5) Textures are not that great. There is motion blur that makes VR difficult to impossible to play (no way to turn it off either). The beginning part of Ethan riding his car in 1st person shows really muddy\, ugly and poorly rendered grass and vegetation that feels like it was down scaled for VR. Even when it fully renders it is barely standard.I like Resident Evil 7.

The slow\, plodding movement only makes sense in the context of expensive \""3D\"" head-tracking goggles\, or possibly an attempt to create extra tension within the mostly vanilla slasher-flick environment.The usual clunky interface is present\, yet presents less of an obstacle than expected--relatively speaking. Detailed visuals more than manage to set the disturbing tone with a mix of realism and \""found footage\"" style. The sound design is also particularly impressive\, but the mixed-bag of English voice acting ruins and enhances the mood in equal measure--unless you're in it for the whole B-movie shtick for which the series is known. No one plays this sort of thing expecting a deep plot\, so the thick layer of otherwise solid cheese in VII's writing is unlikely to scare anyone away.There are also several difficulty levels\, weapon upgrades\, and secrets that invite multiple runs through Capcom's twisted little nightmare. Purists may be repelled by the break with tradition\, but overall\, i would rank this among the best that the series has to offer.

While I am only 4 hours through the game\, I will separate what I love from what I hated\, and update the review further as I progress.*Pros- The game gives you the illusion of safety through high ammo counts\, but as soon as Jack or the molded enemies appear\, you go through ammo so fast without even realizing it\, leading you to helplessly run or stand your ground\, pull out your knife\, and do it the old fashioned way.- Puzzles are back\, and although most are not nearly as complex as previous examples\, they are always satisfying to solve and never make you feel dumb or frustrated.- Jack\, the \""daddy\"" of the family\, is one scary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He's relentless\, and doesn't let up unless you cap him in the head a few times\, or in the body multiple times. His dialogue is great\, and sometimes even lessens the tension with his humor\, before he smacks you with his shovel to get you serious again. He's unpredictable\, and isn't just out to kill you\, but taunt and toy with you as well.- Detail inside of the house is beautifully horrifying\, from it's hallways covered in mold to it's dinner tables covered in entrails\, the Baker house is always keeping you on the edge of your seat.- Plenty of collectibles to find during your journey\, and some of them reward you greatly if you can find enough! Also\, lockpicks are a big part in this game\, but are very limited. So you need to pick and choose what you decide to unlock. You usually end up in a situation where there are 3 things you need to unlock\, but you only have one lockpick.- PC optimization is great! Plenty of graphics options\, uncapped framerate\, Gsync support for the real enlightened PC gamers out there\, as well as resolutions up to 4K and HBAO+ AO for Nvidia users.*Cons- Some character models kind of look odd. Something about Marguerite Baker in particular just looks out of place. Her face looks like shes had 500 plastic surgeries done and it's just ugly to look at. I'm not sure if that's what they were going for\, but I wish it was a little better.- Sometimes it's just TOO ♥♥♥♥ing dark. Like I want to play on the recommended brightness\, but it makes item discovery 10x harder when you can barely see. I don't know why the flashlight is something only the game can turn on instead of something you can turn on and off whenever you please.- There are some textures that really look awful. I thought the PC version would alleviate this\, but a PC can only put as much effort in as the developers did. Still better on PC with high refresh rates\, game runs like butter.Overall\, I am totally LOVING this game so far. I think it's absolutely phenomenal and worth every penny. Please don't hold out and risk getting spoiled! If you're interested\, buy it now.5 hours in\, Resident Evil VII is a clear 10/10 for me.

I wish there were less puzzles and more combat in the final product. I've put 5 hours into the game\, and I think that I've only killed 4 enemies to date\, but I've solved at least 7 puzzles already. That ratio is way off\, and the game would be so much better if it didn't force you to solve strange shadow puzzles in the middle of an abandoned Louisiana estate.

Yes\, it is a stark departure from Resident Evil of old\, but the complaints about that are trivial. It abandoned Resident Evil norms for something better: a visceral survival-horror experience and a return to form that Capcom hasn't displayed since\, arguably\, the very first Resident Evil.Resident Evil as a franchise is all over the map in terms of scariness\, gunplay\, and the like\, and this game reverses what has been a rather negative course in the recent history of the series. For the first time in a while\, you feel helpless within the confines of one of the most genuine horror settings I can think of. The Baker house is brutally detailed and full of heart; there are so many items and environmental cues to chart the descent into madness that has surrounded the home and the family. I actually was afraid just being there. Unlike RE5\, 6\, or Revelations\, you're not a special forces soldier with an arsenal and a buddy at your disposal. You have weapons\, but your best bet is often to find an alternative to fighting\, or risk some pretty brutal and visually engaging fatalities. Think Outlast meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre\, but with more polish and vision. It is horrible and fascinating and it paces the action so well. It also keeps you horrifyingly uneasy\, throughout my time playing\, I never stopped thinking: I do not belong here.Perhaps the only drawback I can come up with is that\, at times\, it feels too much like Outlast and recent FPS horror games\, and plays on some recycled tropes at times. For example\, an initial encounter with the Baker family puts the player in a familiar situation in modern horror: hide\, wait\, listen for footsteps\, and try and sneak around a patrolling baddie. While this format has the ability to ratchet up the tension with frequent chases and unnerving changes of pace\, after a death or two it loses all impact. At that point\, the fear of capture no longer outweighs the frustration of defeat\, so sprinting around and largely ignoring the atmosphere becomes a habit to progress. While it certainly isn't a dealbreaker\, and this specific sequence is thus far the major one like it that I've experienced\, I hope encounters like that are fewer and farther between in RE7 than they are in other titles as I progress further.Overall\, it is terrifying\, visually stunning in a grotesque way\, the story is compelling\, the location is already legendary in my pantheon of horror...

It's honestly my favorite Resident Evil game since RE2.The reason IAs an old-school Resident Evil fan who was brought up on games like RE1 and RE2\, Nemesis and Code Veronica\, this game was a true return to form -- a AAA-class iteration on Nakanishi's already-firm grasp of the classic Resident Evil formula\, as demonstrated by his excellent spin-off game\, Resident Evil: Revelations. It's honestly my favorite Resident Evil game since RE2.The reason I liked the original games so much is not only because of what I consider true survival horror gameplay\, but also because of the focused\, contained narratives. They were games when Umbrella Corp still had an air of mystery\, and when villains like Wesker (before he became a mustache-twirling caricature)\, William Birkin\, and Ashford\, actually managed to matter to players.For me\, RE4 is where the Resident Evil story began to go off the rails. I found the Majini silly\, and the storyline just a regurgitation of previous tropes with a lot of the mystery stripped away. Admittedly\, I liked RE4's gameplay\, but it also marked a departure that with each subsequent game grew increasingly distant from what made the series so addictive in the first place. Resident Evil 7: biohazard is finally the Resident Evil I have been waiting for. It's the first game that\, for me\, managed to exceed Resident Evil 2 -- in my opinion\, RE's pinnacle game -- in all these many years.While I think I still liked the story of Leon\, the Birkins\, and Ada Wong the most\, RE7 came in close with a deeply personal tale that also has some powerful hidden connections to the Resident Evil universe. What starts out as a seemingly unrelated Outlast-like horror story with dark themes about love\, family\, and loss\, quickly evolves into a clear Resident Evil title with heavy gunplay\, BOWs\, a wide variety of weaponry\, secret upgrades\, inventory management\, and a claustrophobic spine-tingling environment that evokes Resident Evil 1's Spencer mansion\, as well as other sections which wink at Nakanishi's RE: Revelations. All that combined to win me over completely.Do not be fooled: What advertising and certain naysayers (read: trolls) have depicted as a stealth-oriented survival horror game in the vein of the aforementioned Outlast\, or Amnesia\, is quite false. While there's one enemy earlier in the game who you have to evade for a time\, every other situation in the overwhelming majority of RE7 can be handled by shooting first and running later (provided you have enough ammo). And for those who complain that the game doesn't tell you what to do\, every time you die there's a handy manual for your current chapter that you can scroll through on the loading screen. It gives you all the info you need.Before long\, you're hurled into dark corridors\, scrambling for ammo\, cheering at every headshot\, cursing at every wasted round\, jumping from unexpected spawns\, your heart pounding at every shadowy corner. And you really get a feel for these characters\, and the darkness that's invaded their lives. What I expected to be a cliche story about a guy searching for his missing and presumably dead wife subverted those expectations on every level\, instead delivering a powerful and mysterious tale where even the villains had earned my sympathy.And for those who are wondering whether RE7 really does tie into the main series -- yes\, it does\, very much so. Although you'll have to be a true RE buff (or\, alternately\, use the power of Google) to fully grasp it. Once you've beaten the game\, I recommend looking up the main character himself. You might be surprised at the hidden connections\, with strong ties to the main storyline.As for complaints about how short the game is\, it's well in line with virtually every other Resident Evil title. On a speed run\, you could probably complete the game in 4-5 hours flat. But on my first playthrough\, on Normal difficulty\, I took my time\, and clocked in just under 15 hours. More would've been great simply because I loved the game\, but the playtime was solid\, with the unlockable Madhouse difficulty and collectibles providing incentive for multiple go-rounds for completionists.I'd actually give the game a 9.25 out of 10\, because I would've liked some more puzzle complexity\, rather than what I'd call \""environmental problem-solving\"" which characterized most of the game's minor head-scratchers. However\, they were all built in an active and engaging manner\, and I never found myself not having fun\, just occasionally wishing there was a little bit more to them. I also didn't mind limited variety on standard enemy types\, because there were so many other fun encounters\, but I could see how people might want more. However I've rated it a full 10 to combat some of the 0 score trolling.I\, for one\, am confident in the Resident Evil series moving forward under Nakanishi's leadership. I can't wait to check out the DLC\, and to see where the series goes from here… Expand",True,0.9123589396476746,0.9108771085739136,0.6887808442115784,0.918461799621582,0.7220564484596252,0.7655666470527649,0.3175954818725586,0.7213488817214966,0.5161915421485901

Not the paranormal mind bending type horror like Silent Hill\, but a more confronting and claustrophobic type and it just works so well in first person.The game focuses on the Baker family who are ready to kill you for trying to rescue Mia after capture. No spoilers involved here\, but its very clever as to why they want you dead.The games graphics are some the best I have seen in a long time. Not just for resident evil games\, but for games in general.Normally games fall short in gameplay as a sacrifice for graphics\, but I can safely say it doesn't for this. The core game will probably take you anywhere between 7-10 hours depending on how well you're going. This to me\, is the perfect game length due to the pacing of it. Its not too slow or too fast.I need to emphasise that NOTHING is overdone. Think of it like a box of goods - It's all compact\, presented neatly and nothing is scattered.There are smooth transitions between each area and you are never playing in each place for too long.- There aren't copious amounts of enemy encounters so they are arranged appropriately- Bosse's aren't in huge numbers and they are also situated at the perfect points of the game like the common enemies.- The voice acting is mind blowing movie quality. There are no cheesy lines or over stretched dialogue\, just natural and raw emotion. Each character has their own characteristics which make them even more disturbing. Marguerite for example - the pitch of her screams while shes hunting you down really scared the hell out of me.Eventhough normal difficulty is good as it is\, Madhouse mode brings out the best of the game. It forces you to play differently. Items are re-arranged in other places and you need cassette tapes to save. It makes you think when to save your game. Saving as soon as you see 3 tapes on the table is usually not the best choice. It tricks you and makes you think beyond what you would normally do. Sometimes you may have to survive for a long time and collect several items before you trigger a boss and THEN save. Keep those cassette tapes for dear life and use them wisely. Madhouse mode is extremely difficult\, but not a frustrating difficult. If you die\, its your own fault. The game is fair enough to challenge your mind by doing the not-so-obvious work around for you to succeed.If i had to pick on something\, I would say at least one more enemy type could have been good for the game. But then again\, the limited enemies that are in the game are placed thoughtfully and their patterns change depending on what you do.Amazing game.9/10… Expand",True,0.18513700366020203,0.3379288613796234,0.3017479479312897,0.8405187129974365,0.5403547883033752,0.3077962398529053,0.2548365592956543,0.4253993034362793,0.26551446318626404

This is where it ISN'T a Resident Evil game.With that said\, it plays\, feels and moves like the older RE games\, with FPS tank movement\, limited supplies\, big boss fights\, creepy atmosphere\, jump scares\, scary stuff\, etc.  During your first playthrough\, this game is a true rollercoaster ride and WILL challenge you.Should you go for the Madhouse difficulty playthrough\, you're looking at a serious test in skill.  (Unless you are a masochistic gamer whose favorite game is Dark Souls and play only on the hardest settings...then it's not)  Outside of that\, playing through the game gets boring and loses it's fun.  Which does always happen in most of the Resident Evil games.  Had the game been given more out of the box content\, vice a DLC season pass.  Resident Evil 7 would've been a near perfect experience\, then again ALL games are doing this now\, and Capcom is a bigger offender of this type of marketing; so I won't hold it against the game.Resident Evil 7 is a perfect example of how survival horror is done right.  Just don't expect more after a couple playthroughs.… Expand",True,0.056628935039043427,0.06963448226451874,0.021038616076111794,0.33542579412460327,0.1348598152399063,0.0820327177643776,0.040590181946754456,0.1853840947151184,0.2285851091146469
90160,RE7B,2017-03-22,10.0,"*Caveat: Resident Evil 7: Biohazard as a base game is a 9/10. With the Playstation VR\, the entire package is a 10/10. It also took me roughly 10 hours to beat. Some light spoilers as well.*Returning to the roots of survival horror was vital for Capcom as they return to what made Resident Evil great in the first place. Taking clear inspiration from RE 1\, this game takes place in Dulvey\, Louisiana in the bayou\, which is an eerie and tone-setting environment. At the forefront of this setting\, you play as Ethan Winters; just a dude looking for his wife\, Mia Winters after she has gone missing for X amount of time. As Ethan arrives to the bayou\, he runs into the Baker family in their home; Jack\, Marguerite\, Lucas\, and a mysterious grandmother in a wheelchair (who is easily one of the most scary aspects of this game due to her just staring at you—no movement\, no chase scenes\, she just watches you silently). Ethan needs to find Mia\, and escape the infected Baker family.RE 7 changes from a 3rd person game\, to a 1st person view game. As a Resident Evil purist\, I initially found this to be a strange design decision. After playing the game multiple times though\, I can say that the 1st person camera angle is a very welcome design choice for the series. Combined with the disturbing environment of the Baker home\, the 1st person camera offers more immersion and the feeling of isolation that the game lives and dies on. You do in fact feel isolated\, confined\, and claustrophobic. Admittedly\, the gun play leaves some to be desired—it can feel clunky at times\, but it works well with what is there. The game has puzzle elements like in older games; some can be easy\, and some can be challenging\, but not so much to make the player feel completely stupid. Upgrades to your character can be obtained by collecting coins around the game\, and trading them in at a trailer for increased health\, weapons\, etc. Also\, there is no HUD in the game\, all your info will come up when you interact by shooting\, and your health meter can be looked it by taking a glance at your wrist Codex\, it makes for better immersion.The first 4 hours of the game are probably the most horrifying hours I have experienced in gaming in years. Within the first hour\, you are chased around the house by Jack Baker\, the psychopathic\, murderous father and later regenerative monster that just oozes the style of Resident Evil. At points\, the player can trigger a moment where Jack bursts through a wall in the first hallway. Marguerite gives just as many scares as she can laughs at points. Her dialogue can be downright hysterical\, while also being intimidating. Her bugs that she can summon on a whim are disgusting\, by the way. Lucas… well\, he’s just kind of a bratty kid with some psychological issues.The overall design of the characters and monsters just scream Resident Evil.Another plus to the game\, is that there is a lack of quick time events\, which is very welcome in my book! It doesn’t try to hold your hand too much. Entering a save room plays some very light\, melancholic music\, which is reminiscent of previous games.Nightmare difficulty mode adds the challenge you would expect; lack of ammo\, tougher enemies\, you take more damage. But it also brings back another thing from old RE games; the player needs to find cassette tapes in order to save their game\, just like ink was needed to save at a typewriter.My gripes with the game are: there isn’t a whole lot of enemy variety type. It makes the game super predictable at times. Secondly\, during the roughly 10 hours it took me to beat the game\, around the 8 hour mark\, there is a portion to the story that feels a little drawn out and boring at times. If the whole game took place at the Baker home\, it would have made the experience more top-notch than it already was.VR mode is a whole other beast. This is what makes the game a 10/10 for me\, and the killer app for a Playstation VR. The game is exactly what you would expect in VR. You get full control of Ethan\, and play the whole game front to back in VR. As far as the camera is concerned\, the player can move completely free with the controller\, or can change it to turn in 30 degree increments to combat motion sickness. The only drawback to VR is having to aim the gun with your own head movements\, which for some can be easy\, but personally\, I found it frustrating. Regardless\, it didn’t take me out of the experience. VR adds the new layer of fear with everybody getting up in your face\, making it as uncomfortable as possible.Overall: if you love or once loved the RE franchise\, please give this game a chance. It has an intriguing story\, good characters\, the Baker family themselves are worthy of playing the game. It brings genuine scares and a smile to me\, and potentially those other survival horror lovers.… Expand",True,0.5717288255691528,0.7661994099617004,0.5570478439331055,0.6297953128814697,0.6028687953948975,0.3398090600967407,0.2200070172548294,0.452674925327301,0.3746815621852875

It runs solid too. I hadn't noticed any significant frame drops or screen tearing during the course of my playthrough. The character models themselves are on point as well. Storywise i don't want to spoil anything\, so i'll try to be as simple as possible. the premise is: you play as a man named Ethan\, who goes to a plantation in Louisiana to find his missing wife Mia. He gets there\, and as you can assume\, resident evil hijinks ensue. The tone of the game is more akin to older resident evil titles rather than the newer ones. It is serious\, yes\, but some of the line deliveries can reach almost campish levels of amusing\, at least to me. I'm not sure if that one on purpose\, but i hope it was. In terms of the actual plot i liked it a lot. I saw some hate for the ending section\, but i didn't think it was that bad. Disappointing? a little\, yeah. But not bad.A significant portion of the game is dedicated to exploring and puzzles. The puzzles aren't too hard to figure out\, and exploring the house made me feel tension i haven't felt from a game in a long time. Gunplay is toned down down dramatically from the last few resident evil releases. That's not to say it isn't fun however. For the most part the combat is well done. You have a variety of weapons to work with to tackle the challenges you face\, including boss fights\, which i was surprised this game had. Being that there were limited resources to work with\, almost every encounter i had with enemies had me on edge. Some people had problems with the game being in first person\, and i myself have some mixed feelings about it. Yes it's scary\, and yes it makes the shooting tighter\, but my problem with it is more of a character problem than a gameplay problem. See Ethan as a character isn't that great. Yeah i know the focus is more on the family than him but still. I feel like if the game was 3rd person he could've felt more like... you know\, an actual interesting character. He would've at least felt more like a genuine character rather than just a vessel for the player to see the game through\, but i diigress.To be honest i had some doubts about this game when it was first revealed.

The visual design is great and the levels and environments while not always completely diverse\, were creative and disturbing. The music is eerie and serine and always at the right place and time. The grotesque sounds of the Bakers where terrifying and the voice acting was mostly great. The story sucks you in and and keeps you interested but never revealing quite what was going on until the very end. The writing is superb and the pacing of the story is fantastic. Resolving the mystery and eventually feeling bad for the Bakers is genius writing. Although the main character is really underwhelming but ultimately a vessel of the player. All of this resolves around the nerve racking game-play and the highlight of the series. The combat is great and always intense. Evading enemies and getting well placed shots is rewarding and create very anxious moments. Shooting feels great and taking out enemies with makeshift weapons will always be satisfying. However the enemies are constantly being reused and there is not much variety causing later hours to falter. Inventory management and obtaining items is fun and tactical. Choosing when and what to craft requires a lot of brain power. The puzzles may cause a bit of backtracking but are great and very fun to solve. Exploration and discovering lore and collectibles allows for many playthroughs as well. However all this tactical and slower paced methodical game-play is sandwiched between spectacular boss fights and creative set pieces. The boss fights are great and diverse and create so much tension and anxiety that cant be found anywhere else. Sadly the final boss fight is far too quick and the latter half somewhat looses momentum.

The visual jump scares seldom feel cheap in part due to the masterful sound design. Making people jump isn’t a difficult task. However\, making people terrified to progress the plot is a daunting task to pull off. Resident Evil 7 absolutely succeeds in pulling off what developer/publisher Capcom set out to accomplish. After the failure of RE6\, the need for the series to return to the survival horror genre became clear. Horror is all about maintaining an atmosphere. Walking down a corridor\, Ethan Winter (the surrogate for the player) might hear some variety of crash off in the next room or in the room above. The mansion is lived in (a slightly inaccurate phrase) and a sense of foreboding never escapes the player except for around the ending. The sound design mixed in with phenomenal limited lighting merge in encouraging the player never be overconfident in a given environment. Unlike previous entries\, the locations are realistically scaled down. The Baker homestead never features a room or ground that feels out of place. In other words\, the property is very much one might find in reality. Conversely\, the game’s need to feature a puzzle at every turn suspends belief every once in awhile. In the end\, the limited environmental scope aids in augmenting the horror. The developers painstakingly created the home to a disturbing degree. Every nook and cranny of the home serve a purpose in telling the Baker family’s story. The player is rewarded at great cost for exploring the environment. In addition\, the exploration feeds into a very enjoyable item management system. All of the items encountered are useful. In order to make backpack space\, the player has to really decide what is the most useful item in a given situation. Looking through your inventory doesn’t stop the game time. You could be looking at the very low ammo of a given gun and suddenly come under attack. In most fights\, the best solution is often to run away until a more advantageous moment. The narrative lasts little more than ten hours. The duration of the experience ensures the plot never drags or overstays its welcome. The mysteries of the circumstances surrounding Ethan Walker are more than enough to ensure the player fights their fear.

I loved the idea of using mold instead of a virus or parasite. Black mold is horrifying enough already as it is\, and it makes for some chilling location and monster designs. The various locations are all themed differently\, with the intro being about abduction\, the second location paying homage to classic backwater horror movies\, the basement being all about mold and monsters\, one location about insects and another putting you through a series of Saw like traps while a maniac toys with you. The final levels are then more combat oriented. This is one of the weaker points of the game\, though luckily the plot begins to make sense by then\, and the final revelations are actually quite tragic. The only real letdown is the final boss fight. By then we feel some sympathy for the main villain\, and a more story driven conclusion may have been more impactful instead of a cliché special effects driven fight. Or maybe one more confrontation with the family\, or a character one disappoints in a pivotal scene. But this is a small nitpick. The only other thing I didn't like was inventory management.

Relax\, I obviously I missed the iconic one and only Chris and his 300 pound arms and Leon with his hair and all but it was about time Capcom introduced in some fresh faces.8) Upgrades: You can upgrade things about your character.9) They have MUCH more content coming and i'm still excited!What could have been better:1) Longer story2) Just two or three new enemies (for the ship part at least).3) Upgradable weapons (I simply love this aspect of upgrading your character in games).In all\, buy the game guys.

The game is currently $60 on PS4 and Xbox One. Resident Evil 7 is a first person Horror/action game that will have you with goosebumps through the entire experience and have you tense till the end. RE is available for the PSVR and will stay that way for a year before it is released for other VR systems. There are few buttons\, and the ones there are\, are easy to understand and you won't even have to think about which one opens the inventory (which in my opinion is very well designed).My Personal ExperienceOverall Resident Evil 7 is very well designed\, especially the characters. Thegraphics are very well done and are quite possibly one of the game's best features. As a RE fan this game definitely brings back the horror of the old games\, but this time in first person. The AI used in the game are the best in the gaming world so far. This newest installment of Resident Evil is riddled with new puzzles\, secrets\, and easter eggs.One problem I found is that there are not a lot of different enemies. They are often the same enemies\, and yes there are bosses and mini-bosses\, but I do not count those as “different” enemies. The main game only lasts about 5-6 hours\, which is why you need to buy the DLC’s (downloadable content) to enjoy the full experience. The DLC’s however cost half as much as the game and only add a few things to the game! Also\, not to spoil anything\, but the ending is really cliché. This game is definitely worth the few extra bucks though and is great for anyone who wants a good old fashion horror game.This game is definitely for older teens or up\, there is extreme violence\, gore\, and use of language. Looking past the cost and M rated title\, this game is very fun to play\, even for just a few hours\, and I give it 4 out of 5 stars.

This game is not of that universe. So I can see where some folks are upset with a bait-and-switch.Now that the elephant in the room has been acknowledged\, this is a pretty decent game and certainly a good VR one. It's touch to play for more than 30 - 60 minutes in the helmet though. Horror + VR definitely = motion barf. The play is fluid and fairly intuitive if limited in interaction. The graphics are touted as photorealistic. I would argue the lighting is\, but sacrifices were made for CR and fluid motion - 3D models are less-refined and textures are large. The developers did a good job with the palette they had under the circumstances and so it's pretty easy to let your critical eyes and focus loosen a bit and feel more in a film.The scares so far are mostly jump scares with a lot of grim surrounding and tense mucking about. It definitely has more of an Amnesiac/Outlast/Blair Witch vibe to it\, as a number of other reviewers have pointed out. The voice acting is just good enough to make you wish it wasn't bad. That is\, it's bad. You'll wish it had been laughably bad though because it tries. Earnestly at times\, it really does. But it's like a singer who just can't quite get that one note.... or twelve.Overall - 7 or 8 out of 10. Pretty on the eyes. Messes with your head. Short for a TV game\, but long for a VR one.

I was amazed it came with two discs to play as different characters\, whose stories intertwine all throughout the game.  I know\, I know you aren't here to read about some punk's past with RE.  I just want to give the reader some context.  RE7 is definitely a return to RE's roots as a survival horror game.  I must say I was super weary about RE7 being in first person but it really does a fantastic job of making the setting and enemies even more unsettling.  Almost in the same way as the original.  Like in the first few RE games\, that third person perspective coupled with the tank controls made every corridor\, and really long hallway super suspenseful\, all because you simply couldn't see anything that was more than 5 or so feet from your character.  The first person perspective works somewhat in the same way.  That cone of vision is super limited\, giving you a very uneasy feeling.  I am not ashamed to admit that it is f@#king scary as all hell.  Not just cheap jump scares either.  I am talking 100% bonafide terrifying.  One gripe I have\, and I don't want to spoil anything for you here so I will be super vague\, but it is really difficult at times knowing when you are supposed to fight or run.  This lead to being very wasteful in terms of ammunition\, and getting myself in really bad situations.  You could say that it just lead to an even more cautious play style\, but an annoyance none the less.  I am not real sure about anyone else but for me using VR is the BEST way to play\, and honestly could not see myself playing any other way.  I'm shocked I haven't seen many people that was all that impressed with the VR gameplay.  Anyway\, if you are a long time RE fan I think you will like this one.

This is the sequel that should have been after loud outcries were made in reaction to Resident Evil 5's inevitable new direction. Better late than never they say\, as the newest entry in the series not only goes back to its roots\, it also wraps the best qualities of Resident Evil 1\, 3 and 4 in a very compelling package.The game brilliantly adopts the strengths of its prime predecessors and works them into a fine synergy. This means you'll be wandering a residence (pun intended)\, dogged by a nemesis-like antagonist\, while conserving your resources for some of the most gruesome boss fights in Resident Evil history. Puzzles are back\, but they are neither too tough nor very interesting.One thing that might discourage (die-hard) fans from playing this game\, however\, is the change in camera perspective.

I made this point in my review to Final Fantasy XV with changes in gameplay for a more fresh approach in a game series as the titles are now adding up.Obviously all of us were not a fan of Capcom's effort in 2012 with the hopeful blockbuster survival horror\, Resident Evil 6.

I got a sense of nostalgia from it due to many key elements that were shown in the game that I did not expect at all. Then let's take away the title for a moment and look at the game itself. It was a fun challenging game with just the right amount of horror to it. The puzzles and environments were engaging and the boss battles were some of the most fun boss battles I've encountered in a game. I was truly wowed by this game and cannot express how happy I am that Capcom has proven me wrong. I look back at how I was hating the game before release and thinking about Capcom just saying \""Just trust us.\"" That trust has certainly been earned.… Expand",True,0.5036497712135315,0.4595526456832886,0.4232467710971832,0.7857068777084351,0.6003881692886353,0.6955424547195435,0.7909612655639648,0.7640934586524963,0.7370547652244568

90235,RE7B,2017-01-30,10.0,"I believe this game deserves a solid 8.5 score. The reason I'm giving it a 10 is to balance some of the negative reviews which gave the game a 0 because they said \""why is there ghost's in the game? It's not RE\"". They have clearly not played the game and are going off the test demo (btw there are no ghost's in the game).The first half of the game feels like RE2 with the puzzles\, limited supplies\, and inventory management (I'm only comparing it to RE2 and not RE1 is because the puzzles in RE1 were much more complicated and RE2 was more lenient). The second half feels like RE5 with more action. Of course\, if you were not conservative with supplies in the first half of the game\, you'll still have to consider ammunition and herb usage.Is it frightening? Definitely if you have not been desensitized to horror trends (especially in the US\, I've been watching streams and people are definitely more scared in other countries). Truthfully\, for me there were a few jumps but not enough to make it frightening. I would compare it to Condemned or FEAR in terms of scare.Madhouse is also very challenging. It really tests your knowledge of the enemy and bosses and you will always have to decide whether to risk using ammo or running\, because ammo is much more precious in Madhouse.The bosses\, for the most part\, are underwhelming. The 2nd boss fight was pretty decent\, and the 3rd boss fight was good and truly felt like a RE boss fight\, but the last boss was horrible. More cinematic than anything. FYI there is a special molded\, which I would consider a miniboss and even harder than some bosses in Madhouse.I also thought the enemy variety was good\, but could have added 1 or 2 more types. There's 4 molded types and 4 bosses (if you don't count the introduction). Also\, there are bugs\, but their more of an obstacle...a very annoying obstacle.Overall\, it was a very good game. Probably the best RE since RE4. The first-person view was a refreshing change. I'm sorry for those that don't understand this\, but 3rd person horror games aren't scary. I think the last time I was truly scared in 3rd person was Silent Hills when I was a child. I'm not saying 3rd person horror games aren't good (for example Dead Space and Alan Wake were really good imo)\, but 1st person adds the horror aspect while still maintaining the survival aspect.… Expand",True,0.7121105790138245,0.6793479323387146,0.43193763494491577,0.8799937963485718,0.7319702506065369,0.5918264985084534,0.6699536442756653,0.7308638691902161,0.944161057472229

I've noticed the Baker family events are scripted aswell and unlike Nemesis in RE3 is not random at all.At the end of the day this is a poor mans Resident Evil and being first person does not help. I'm more shocked over the \""high\"" reviews praising the game but it's obvious Resident Evil 6 lowered expectations so much that anything after would be better.Yes it is a horror game and you would think it's \""back to its roots\"" but the problem is the game is a jump scare horror game and not a survival horror game. Imagine the dog window scene in the first game stretched out over the entire game\, imagine if the first game relied on those moments alone while the survival stuff was sprinkled in\, that's how to describe RE7. Herbs\, weapons\, some enemies and the like are just added to make it seem it's a return to form when really it's notI'm more sad that people seem to be buying into this. Guys it's an alright game but not Resident Evil...we've just been thrown bad RE game after bad RE game that now we'll take anything we can get.This is not Resident Evil...this is a new IP which is chasing after the P.T crowd. Save your money and buy Yakuza 0 or wait for Horizon Zero Dawn. We can not let Capcom turn Resident Evil into something it's not. This would effect the Resident Evil 2 Remake and do you really want that?… Expand",True,0.5839478373527527,0.3689746856689453,0.19792568683624268,0.801180899143219,0.5091785192489624,0.4287312626838684,0.39416319131851196,0.4878599941730499,0.8378599286079407
90339,RE7B,2018-01-23,8.0,"Resident Evil 7 is a survival horror game developed by Capcom\, and is apart of the Resident Evil series.With introductions aside\, let me say that this is the first Resident Evil game I have sat down and played.

I didn’t purchase this game\, I rented it. I’ve been reading the reviews for this game both positive and negative\, and would like to discuss things I found in the reviews alongside my own review.The game is stunning graphically\, and the sounds are refined. The first 30 minutes were definitely the scariest time I had in my playthrough. The ambience is excellent coupled with the unsureness of when you’ll be scared next. I enjoyed the first person view\, and I’m seeing this is a first for the series. A reviewer stated that the first person view was frustrating because you can’t judge the speed in which the enemy is chasing you–That’s the point! This is a horror title\, do expect to know what’s going on?There are many puzzles in the game\, which at times can be slightly frustrating as I used a guide once or so\, but once you get the hang of the game you’ll understand better. There are mini stories in the form of VHS tapes which adds different terrifying scenarios whilst playing. The combat was exciting at first but I must admit\, it was boring towards the end seeing as there really is only one true enemy type. The bosses were memorable\, though the character you play isn’t. There are some holes within the game that when I played\, it seemed alright\, but after reading a review pointing things out\, it kind of hit me. As long as you aren’t as nitpicky as I am\, it shouldn’t affect you any\, just minor story points that should’ve been fleshed out.Overall\, I do recommend the game\, but I don’t recommend you buy it. Unless you plan on buying the dlc\, renting it for even a day can give you the game’s full experience. People compare this to Outlast which I can understand\, but they are definitely different experiences. At least in this game there isn’t a terribly dreadful ‘turn the power back on’ mission.… Expand",True,0.3239055573940277,0.2461583912372589,0.29374295473098755,0.4861801266670227,0.24495945870876312,0.2129322588443756,0.21893608570098877,0.3337313234806061,0.8021679520606995

By that\, I’m referring to the original game and its remake – both in its setting and level design. Most of it works\, but there are some issues.Most of the game feels reminiscent of those earlier titles. Item examination\, elaborate puzzles\, backtracking and long stretches of inaction – even the life meter is a call back to the original. Combat also harkens back to the fight or flight scenarios common before the action focussed redirection the series took. Movement however\, is clumsy during tense moments as your character can barely run. To articulate\, it’s akin to the uneven trot one breaks into when they’re 95% sure they’ll catch the bus in time\, but just want to be sure. No contextual reason is given for this and I wonder if it’s associated with VR. Ultimately\, it’s more frustrating than it is frightening. Aiming is somewhat difficult too\, but this design choice succeeds in creating tension due to a focus on ammo preservation.The story is mostly compelling\, although most survival horror narratives are to a degree as they rely on mystery and building dread. It’s sometimes campy and sometimes earnest as in parts the series is known for\, but it kept me intrigued. The third act however\, I found underwhelming - not terrible\, just mundane and I feel they missed an opportunity in the characterisation of the chief antagonist. Character development has never been a strong point in the series though\, so perhaps that’s too harsh.The voice cast is a mixed bag also. All but one of the family are very well executed whereas the rest are the common middling quality of most AAA titles and lastly the main character is…well\, he sounds bored to be frank. I suppose it stands out more in to the contrast to the tone of the rest of the cast.I recommend the game if you have a sentimental spot for the gameplay and tone of the PS One/GameCube titles. If you’re not familiar with those but enjoy survival horror games\, you might find something here too. Personally\, I was rarely scared outside of one section near a boss encounter. I was often alert and generally cautious\, but not to the point that I would dread traversing from room to room. In short\, an encouraging reinvention that is neither the best nor worst the series has offered but is certainly on an upward tangent.… Expand",True,0.5098975896835327,0.5064424276351929,0.4757969379425049,0.8573277592658997,0.4312897324562073,0.773635745048523,0.6851399540901184,0.6648590564727783,0.8618384003639221

They didn't say anything Resident Evil like T-Virus\, Nemesis Virus\, Zombies or any other characters from any Resident Evil\, though there is a magazine that shows the destruction of Raccoon city and some monsters and Bosses presenting themselves like the previous Resident Evil games. But overall the story is very well connected of what was going on when playing the game. The game wasn't scary beside them always popping up right in front of you\, this feels very cringe especially people who have a phobia of bugs. Although it felt like I was playing Outlast then Resident Evil.Gameplay - The gameplay is what represents Resident Evil. When you find herbs and chemical bags to combine them into first aid bottles and also getting ammo and reserving them shows that element of Resident Evil. Even killing monsters with a knife feels satisfying just like all resident evil games.Mechanics - Easy to learn. But it would be better if the player has the ability to melee monsters and boxes while holding a weapon\, though it will look and act like a Call of Duty Game.Conclusion - The Story should show more references in cutscenes and give the players the euphoria back in the days of Resident Evil. Gameplay and Mechanic were spot on. If you were looking forward to this game being Resident Evil\, don't give your hopes up as this is game is trying to be PT mixed with Outlast but it doesn't mean this game is bad because it's still overall fun to play especially the DLC that is coming out soon.Final Verdict:8/10… Expand",True,0.46361345052719116,0.29595980048179626,0.14133381843566895,0.7456464767456055,0.34637969732284546,0.4758056104183197,0.464253306388855,0.5136252641677856,0.6048338413238525

What I loved though and hats off to Capcom for that\, is how they managed to make Resident Evil 7 a potpourri of the best components of all previous games: the atmosphere and tension of the first 3\, the action packed-but still atmospheric style of 4 and Revelations and the omission of everything that 5 and 6 got wrong (I doubt there was anything right especially about 6 but anyway).

RE7 is trying to be equal parts action game and horror game\, and it does neither very well.A good horror game doesn't need great controls\, but it needs good atmosphere\, pacing\, and a story that makes you care at least a little about the characters.  I don't particularly care about the story tying into the RE universe (I found the premise of the older games pretty corny).  However\, I found myself not caring about the main characters at all\, since I didn't really have a reason to (they're voiced well\, but have almost no depth).  The atmosphere here is also anything but subtle or creepy\, it's more just gory than anything else.  Maybe that's really frightening to some people\, but I got bored and complacent very quickly.On the other hand a good action game needs tight controls and engaging mechanics.  This is what RE4 pioneered (and then RE5 and 6 copied\, watered down\, and wore out).  The controls here are extremely clunky.  To name a few things:  Attache access is real time and not well implemented\, quick turn is difficult to pull off consistently (holding back and hitting circle doesn't make you turn?)\, strafing left or right too much slows your moving speed to a crawl\, enemies don't react or animate well\, often clipping through you\, the AI is far too easily fooled (run around a corner and crouch behind a box and they will suddenly lose interest in pursuing you\, why not let us hide in cupboards\, under beds\, etc. like someone actually trying to hide?)\, boss fights are for the most part confusing and annoying after you die 5 times in a row having no clue what you're supposed to be doing.Graphically it's a mixed bag\, some scenes have near photo-realism\, but many others are bland and washed out.  Texture pop in happens enough to be noticeable\, and some of the full res textures\, particularly on flat objects\, are extremely blurry (text is completely unreadable\, looks like PS2 era).In the end it most closely resembles Outlast\, but with a less engaging story\, more bland atmosphere\, hindering controls\, and inferior graphics.  Horror wise its scares become predictable\, the story and characters aren't particularly engaging\, and the atmosphere is far more gory than scary.
