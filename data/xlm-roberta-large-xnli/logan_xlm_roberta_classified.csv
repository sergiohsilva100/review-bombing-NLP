101574,Logan,2017-03-03,5,"Although I'm going to hold out hope that Ryan Reynolds can convince Hugh Jackman to return for Deadpool 2\, this would be one hell of a way to go out. The R rating made me a bit skeptical as it seemed a bit reactionary to capitalize on the success of Deadpool\, but it is used as a great story telling element that helped set the tone of the movie. Logan delivers on a multitude of levels for extreme ass-kickery in an extraordinary blend of action sequences and emotional gut punches making it easily the best X-men related film to date. Director James Mangold unleashes Wolverine in an adventure that gives fans of the iconic comic book character a long overdue showcase of the animal within. But for those unfamiliar with the franchise\, there is still a heartfelt action-packed story will keep you thoroughly entertained for one wild ride. To no surprise\, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart give us the best performances in their franchise long tenure. Stewart captures the frail humanity of Professor X as he battles an unknown neurological disease without any sacrifice to his wise and even-tempered demeanor. Both he and Jackman bring a very seasoned and damaged presence that is almost painful to watch for those who have long been fan's of the franchise. I'm a little mixed on Dafne Keen's performance as X-23/Laura\, though at no fault of her own. For the majority of the movie I actually found her character to be quite irritable. The creators definitely went for a rebellious feral child kind of personality to emphasize her similarities with Logan and her ability to bring forth mass carnage. Even though given the context of Laura's upbringing this makes sense\, she spends about two-thirds of the movie shrieking with no audible dialogue in a manner that I found overly petulant. Luckily\, the third act manages to salvage her character in a way that makes me excited to see more of her in the future. Wolverine spends so much of Logan getting beaten down and struggling to get up rather than maiming his enemies\, that it really paints him our beloved hero in a fashion that we're not accustomed to. Quite honestly\, it took some time to realize he's no longer the bruiting beast we're used to seeing\, especially with X-23 outdoing him in almost every action sequence. Although it was a bit tough to digest that a small child is causing more bloodshed than our Adamantium-covered brute\, she definitely proves her strength. No one will ever replace Wolverine\, but we're in great hands with X-23 as she maims\, shreds\, hacks\, stabs\, and gouges her way in a series of flips\, kicks\, punches\, and leaps like you could not imagine without seeing for yourself. I wasn't too big a fan of the route they chose to give Logan a formidable opponent\, but that aside\, this third act is one of most spectacular I've seen by a comic book movie - perhaps ever. Mangold ties up Logan's \""final\"" run in a beautiful amalgamation of tear jerking moments and some much needed violence. All questions that you may have during the movie are answered in a way that doesn't feel shoehorned in and gives us one \""last\"" glimpse of Wolverine's unrelenting spirit to stand up for what's right and his inability to shy away from a fight - no matter the odds or consequences.\n\nScore - 9.5/10\n\nP.S. - No end credit scene\, only pre-film scene. Mangold masterfully does this to keep the tone set by the ending of the film intact.",True,0.3587028980255127,0.3840489685535431,0.3192093074321747,0.36649805307388306,0.2860018312931061,0.32363104820251465,0.3294455111026764,0.36121779680252075,0.4405854046344757

101636,Logan,2017-03-04,1,"Although the actors do their job well\, this is just a BRAINLESS SLASHER MOVIE.  A typical X-Men movie has a smart captivating plot\, complex characters including the villains\, spectacular visual effects\, and much more.  Here is the plot of this movie (without spoilers):  An army of muscle bound special force soldiers attack Wolverine and get slashed to pieces - claws through the head - with blood and body parts flying all over.  The good guys get away but get attacked again and the same thing happens.  They get away again\, and then - you guessed it - same thing happens.  By the last bloodbath I was falling asleep due to the sheer stupidity of it.  As you may have seen from the trailer\, a young girl takes part in all the fighting and is even more vicious than Wolverine.  Apparently it's ok for a pre-teen girl to slash people to pieces - because hey\, they are the bad guys\, they deserve it.  The movie also DOES NOT STAY TRUE TO THE XMEN BACKSTORY AND FREQUENTLY TURNS INTO NONSENSE.  For example\, in previous movies we are told that an adamantium bullet would not kill a being with an adamantium skull\, but would erase memories.  This movie thinks however that an adamantium bullet can blow off half of an adamantium skull.  There are other examples\, but I don't want to give away the plot.  Bottom Line:  I love the X-Men series and have seen every movie\, sometimes multiple times.  This one is not worth seeing in a theater (unless you are into Halloween Slasher movies\, because in that category it's top notch).",True,0.22980982065200806,0.2136669009923935,0.18738041818141937,0.21683011949062347,0.19185832142829895,0.20657013356685638,0.20166578888893127,0.24223577976226807,0.21846255660057068

Logan is now an aging\, grey haired\, broken man whose special healing ability has weakened over time. He now spends his time working as a limo driver whilst caring for Professor X. The professor is now also very old and weak\, suffering from a brain disease that causes violent seizures which has resulted in many X-Men being killed. \n\nLogan reluctantly accepts a job to escort a woman and young girl to a refuge in North Dakota. Alas it seems the young girl (Laura) has the same powers as Logan and a shady outfit are after her. The shady outfit in question being Transigen\, a company that uses children with mutant DNA to create weapons. Transigen created Laura and want her back. And so Logan must now help Laura reach the refuge in North Dakota.\n\nSo the main hook with this movie seemed to be the fact it was an R/18 rating. This would be the first time we would see Wolverine really getting stuck into his enemies\, swear and showcase a lot of claret. In all honesty that pretty much seemed like the entire reason for the hype to me. This time there would be no cuts\, we'd see Wolverine stick his claws through someones head...and there would be blood\, awesome. But was it? Was it really? I mean sure twas cool 'n' all but Jesus Christ I didn't cum in my pants or anything. I guess for a teenager this might have been epic but for me I saw nothing special.\n\nBut that aside lets look at the story and acting. The plot isn't anything amazing\, its essentially a standard chase formula. Bad guys are trying to catch the good guys as both parties tear across the countryside. Wolverine is the typical reluctant hero\, he doesn't really wanna have to deal with it\, he has his own problems\, but he now finds himself in the thick of it. The girl he's stumbled across was more of a pain at first\, uncontrollable\, a burden; but as time passes he becomes attached to her\, he becomes her guardian. Its all relatively bog standard stuff we've all seen before.\n\nObviously the movie revolves around Jackman and his gritty performance as Logan. As I just said\, at first he doesn't really wanna get involved with Laura\, he has his hands full with Xavier. So naturally he's grumpy\, rude\, kinda selfish in a way\, but ultimately tired and weary of his existence. He's aging and slowing down\, he's not as agile or fit as he once was and his claws hurt him as they extend and retract. He doesn't wanna get into any fisticuffs but still finds himself raging out and killing people\, mostly scummy criminal types of course. But is this really anything new? I mean lets be honest here we've seen Jackman do this grumpy\, gritty\, no-nonsense persona before with Wolverine\, its not really that new. Is he good at it? Yes\, very much so\, but this wasn't an outright Oscar performance or anything\, he didn't blow me away whilst watching.\n\nI feel the same way about Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier. Was this a good performance? Yes very much so\, Stewart like Jackman have both perfected their performances as these characters and it would be hard to see another person in the roles. But did I see anything that blew me away or was any different to what he's done before in previous movies with this character? No not really\, it was a solid performance but nothing more than what I've come to expect from this franchise. There is a shit-tonne of emotion radiating throughout this movie and at times\, namely the ending\, its quite poignant. But at the end of the day I didn't really see anything that I haven't seen before in previous movies\, it was just more heightened this time.\n\nAs for the kid actor\, Dafne Keen (Laura)\, yes again she was good in her role\, but she hardly had any dialog and merely acts like a feral child when the action kicks in (which always looked kinda cringeworthy in my opinion). Yes I understand she's just a child actor and yes she did put in a solid performance for her age\, but again it didn't blow me away\, it really didn't. Seeing her growl and bounce around (mostly by a stunt double) like a lethal Gollum just didn't wow me I'm afraid. Its only towards the end when she starts trusting and caring about Logan that she actually comes into her own. \n\nI did also notice that all the other child characters in this movie were mostly minority actors. Because clearly director James Mangold and co needed to hammer home the political narrative of minorities/refugees and borders\, striving for freedom\, and the evil white man chasing and trying to enslave/kill them. Its kinda sad that almost every movie these days has these little\, not so hidden\, political angles to appease certain demographics and groups. \n\nFor me I really couldn't get past the fact it was just another samey superhero flick. Despite all the grit and emotion packed into it\, at the end of the day it was the same old thing. The villains were the same corny bunch of faceless kill fodder they always are. There only seems to be a dozen or so hencemen throughout the movie\, then come the finale there's loads of them! Loads of bad guys for all the hero characters to merrily kill. I didn't really understand the point of the bad guys either. They wanted this mutant kids back because they created them\, OK sure. But they only wanted to exterminate them\, so why go to all that trouble to try and capture them? And with all this future tech on display\, you're telling me that no one could have added some kind of device in these mutant test subjects that would shut them down\, or kill them with the flick of a switch\, if needs be? Surely by now these evil companies would have thought to do that because they all seem incapable of keeping their creations under lock and key.\n\nI also really disliked the entire clone of Logan aspect\, I realise that's a major part of his characters backstory but seeing two Jackman's (one looking kinda goofy with those muttonchops) fighting each other just looks stupid. The effects were handled well (inevitable CGI superhero stuff aside) but that kind of thing always looks daft to me. Also the clone of Logan (X-24) could have easily killed him at any point\, just taken his head off\, but no we gotta do the usual throwing thing. That's the other thing about these X-Men.superhero movies\, the action is very repetitive. In other words what else do you expect a bloke with claws to do all the time\, exactly. Seeing Logan slice 'n' dice people isn't awesome anymore folks\, we've been there and done it. Simply adding blood and gore doesn't really make it any more exciting or better.\n\nI just get the impression this movie seems to have been blown way way outta proportion simply because it was Huge Jackaman's last outing as Wolverine and everybody likes him in the role. Oh and of course it was an R rating so that makes it instantly cooler\, apparently. Was this a bad movie? No. Was it a good X-Men movie? One of the best ones? Yes. Was it a stunning movie? No\, it was a solid but completely unoriginal chase movie in a superhero wrapping. Don't get me wrong I didn't not like it\, its certainly one of the better comicbook superhero (based) flicks\, I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.

103720,Logan,2017-03-05,5,"An incredible final outing for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine\, Logan delivers on an unimaginable amount of levels. We begin in a near future on the verge of dystopia\, and meet an old\, tired\, battered  Logan. We follow him on his journey as he takes care of a sick\, damaged Charles Xavier and finds a little girl who desperately needs his help. To start\, Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar. He's now played Logan 10 times\, and this is by far the best performance of his entire career. Patrick Stewart as Professor X also gave an astounding performance\, along will newcomer Dafne Keen as X-23\, who is soon to be a star. All across the board\, the acting was exceptional. Now to the action scenes. I'm going to assume that Keen doesn't do her own stunts\, but you cannot tell that there are stunt people in this movie whatsoever. It is wonderfully realized\, and is only one of the ways that Logan uses its R rating to it's advantage. Although this isn't \""Avengers level\""\, blockbuster action\, it in no way needs to be. I actually seriously appreciated and found it so refreshing to see a \""superhero\"" movie that didn't feel like one at all. This is a gritty\, depressing film that relies heavily on dialogue and things that people say to each other. Action is not a high priority in terms of adding to the story and that pleasantly surprised me walking out of the theater. Speaking of surprising\, the plot of this movie (which I thought would be very confusing walking in) was so easy to follow and was unlike anything from prior X-Men movies. Logan also totally drew me in emotionally\, and I felt myself kind of moved when the end credits started to role. There is also an amazing pre-credits scene\, but nothing after the ending credits (I made the mistake of staying in the theater until the very end\, along with many other people).  All in all\, I was very amazed at how good this film was. Hugh Jackman and the people behind this film deserve all the credit they can get for making one of the best 'superhero' movies of all time. 9/10 \nOh\, also\, DON'T TAKE YOUR CHILDREN! Please.

I could intellectually understand what was the reasoning for this or that\, but I barely felt any emotional connection to what was happening.\n\nThe plot was as simple as they come. Nothing new in that department\, besides the absolutely shattered status of the X-Men which is kind of an interesting idea. The actual plot though is just standard. This movie heavily relies on its character study of old man Logan and a bit of old geriatric man Xavier. Both of them were done well. The claws action was visceral and intense. The makeup was great.\n\nMy problems are these;\nMeandering action sequences (the first one with all the cars outside of Xavier's hideout).\n\nBaffling character choices that don't make sense (tagging along with the black family).\n\nForced subversion during Xavier's burial scene (it's an intriguing idea on paper\, but it was executed a little bit clumsily\, not elegant at all and I didn't felt the movie earned that kind of treatment of Xavier).\n\nWeak finale with all the powerful mutant kids barely putting up a fight and weirdly abandoning Logan to fight by himself while Laura went ham (we didn't see anything about Laura being especially trained in combat\, so I assume that the rest also went through combat training).\n\nUnremarkable cinematography\, very run of the mill scene compositions and framing. Felt like a tv show\, barely felt like a movie.\n\nLaura's hamfisted perfect recitation of the old cowboy movie monologue she somehow managed to fully memorize after one viewing. Didn't know her power was perfect memory. It was one of those \""kid movie talks like an adult\"" movie syndromes.\n\nThe stupid Donald character that didn't deserve to be in as much of this movie as he was.\n\nThis movie was fine\, I didn't suffer\, but it did bug me that this movie was being talked about as an A++ movie\, when it was simply an above average superhero movie.",True,0.3452068269252777,0.3127470016479492,0.3109666705131531,0.3144761025905609,0.2918425500392914,0.3395098149776459,0.2916100025177002,0.30672764778137207,0.30988451838493347

It does eliminate a part of the fan base (pre-teens) but they didn't go overboard with the rating. In the past we have seen Logan plunge his claws into many people but never showed too much blood.

108592,Logan,2017-03-02,5,"Before I start the review\, I wanna let you know that X-men: Days of future past is my favorite X-men film-not anymore. Upon seeing the film for the second time already\, (and another one again later and maybe another one in the near future srsly) Logan surpassed X-men: DOFP by a hair\, it's that beautiful. Personally\, this is the Wolverine film I've been waiting for\, and it delivered\, plus interest.\nWhat makes a film good?\nThe answer: Characters. And this film not only has good characters\, but also has organic chemistry and banter between them.\nThe positives:\nThe performance of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was at its all time best\, it's heartbreaking to know that this is the last time we'll see him play as the character\, as he announced his retirement in playing Wolverine. This performance is rich in heart and so raw with emotion. There are parts in the film that I actually forgot that he's a \""superhero\"" because of Jackman's captivating performance on humanizing the character. Such a magnificent portrayal and rendition of the character\, riddled with layers of grit\, and nuanced emotions.\nHopefully\, this film garners a lot of money to persuade Jackman to reprise his role. FYI he's been playing wolverine since 2000.\nPatrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier was god damn heart wrenching\, which is a testament to his craft as an actor. The subtle nuances that Stewart does as Xavier is seriously sincere and touching. Every scene with him is enthralling\, especially when interacting with Logan (Jackman) and Laura (Keen). Even if you're not initiated in these films\, you will find it very easy to love his character. It's so sad to know that Stewart is also retiring from playing this character along with Jackman.\nThe little girl\, Dafne Keen\, was such a pleasant surprise. Her gaze\, her eyes could kill you without even breaking a sweat\, such perfect casting in a surprising role. I'm excited to see her in more films. There's a subtle line in her performance where innocence meets violence\, a line she most definitely owned. Despite being paired with two highly respected actors of our time\, she flawlessly manages to hold her own\, not getting overshadowed by the awesome performances of Jackman & Stewart.\nWithout getting into spoiler territory\, the overarching plot of the film is pretty straightforward\, but in hindsight it's not really where things end up that matters\, it's about how the story unfolds leading up to the end. Speaking of endings\, the ending of this film hurts so so good. If you're a big fan of the old X-men films back in 2000\, you will need a pick-me-up after that symbolic last scene that left me breathless.\nEven with a runtime of 2 hours and 15 something minutes\, the film didn't feel that way\, it was paced wonderfully\, spacing the action\, and character developing scenes evenly.\nI just love the somber tone and cold feel of this film\, making every scene with the protagonists intimate\, making every line of dialogue between protagonists meaningful\, and poignant.\nThe story\, despite having a lot of themes going on\, is mainly old-school western\, (ala the film \""Shane\"") an ideal theme to color Wolverine in his twilight years.\nThe negatives:\nWhat makes Dafne Keen great in her little girl role as Laura in the film is that she is very convincing as her character. But\, I can't say the same for the other child actors. They were not as convincing as whoever they're playing\, so it kinda sucks to see stellar performances from the main protagonists and then switch to a sub-par performance by the supporting kid characters. It's not that bad. But still bad enough to call out.\nWhere the main protagonists shine\, the main antagonists don't. The antagonists were plain and functional in their roles\, nothing more than skin deep characters. Cookie-cutter antagonists\, with cookie-cutter intensions\, and motivations. What's good is that they didn't ruin the film\, they're not bad\, just stale\, and generic.\nThere's an antagonist here that I feel will be divisive to some fans. While I understand why one might be pissed with the presentation of this character\, it's not that bad as he does not appear in the film that often. Personally\, I'm not a fan. But it's a forgivable decision\, something I can let pass in a beautiful film as a whole. Case and point\, a character of that type and magnitude was needed for the story to have heavier stakes\, so yeah.\nThere are plot points in the film that I wish were more developed or explained. A little more exposition won't hurt\, because I think that it'll just make everything more seamless. Then again\, this is an X-men film\, and as history taught us\, X-men films doesn't give a flying fuck on continuity and timelines.\nOverall:\nLogan is a very special film for me\, because I grew up with these characters.\nI can still remember seeing the very first X-men film back in 2000\, I was 11\, hooked and invigorated with awe and wonder. Now in 2017\, I'm 24\, and seeing these actors play these characters for the last time hurts so good. It's such a profound experience to walk out of the theatre realizing all this\, this uncanny sense of being alive\, and having been alive for that long\, and how much has changed and stayed the same. A keen sensation in the fleeting nature of things. Truly\, the last 3 minutes\, the last scene\, and the last shot was very symbolic for me as it managed to stir something in me\, and move me to think of all of this.\nIt is heart-warming yet equally heart-breaking. It's fucking violent and graphic.\nLogan has set the bar high for films this year. IT'S NOT A PERFECT FILM\, but is still a mesmerizing watch for both the initiated and uninitiated. It has more positives than negatives and with only one divisive variable.\nA unique \""superhero\"" film\, separating itself from the pack\, changing the complexion of the superhero genre from here on out.\nA 17 year character arc journey\, that ends perfectly.\nA serious emotional roller coaster of a film and a love letter to old school X-men film fans.",True,0.5999919772148132,0.5808639526367188,0.6170782446861267,0.5709355473518372,0.5653050541877747,0.5795983672142029,0.5720297694206238,0.5871405005455017,0.5654981136322021

113843,Logan,2017-06-06,4,"Concluding & Acerbic Contemplation For Marvel Comics' Fictional Superhero\n\nWeapon X\, one of the most beloved characters that Marvel has brought to cinema screens\, has departed\, but he has made it in style\, with scarlet blood dripping down his defective adamantium claws and leaving a feasible regeneration based on young mutants in the bequest. After insistent and suggestive promises of director James Mangold\, which were disclosed while he filmed the notorious movie\, \""Logan\"" has finally landed in worldwide cinemas and we have had the opportunity to refute or asseverate whether or not the words of the scholar Marvel-fan were right. In general terms\, the utopian western that Mangold has raised is the definitive entry point to out-of-the- ordinary facets in the genre\, for the true meaning of adapting works with abidance. This installment will cause us to apply Plato's Allegory of the Cave to UCM in all its splendor\, dusting off the glorious\, intelligent\, capable and above all human superhero movies.\n\nIt's 2029. Humanity has been abandoned due to the shortage of saviors\, who have been cut out from the face of the earth enigmatically. Evil has triumphed over good\, however\, evil should wrap up some outstanding issues related to those men who look like the living dead. Dipsomaniac\, battered and prey to dejection because of the enervation of his regenerative faculties; James Howlett lives badly near Mexican borders\, among scant ruins that refer to his corporal\, moral\, sensitive and psychic condition. He has consigned any purpose\, has lost his way\, the only one retaining his subsistence is the man who adopted him with satisfaction\, devotion\, but first of all a man who gave him all the love. Charles Xavier\, who was a scientific genius with a superhuman ability to absorb information\, is also a leading authority on genetics\, mutation\, and psionics\, has been bruised by inflexible old age\, the bitter immanent principle of life. Currently\, he is a male senile\, outdated and cautionary\, victim of a neuropathology of aging that alters his powers and puts at risk the only remaining two beings: Wolverine and X-23. X-23 will come as a girl of few words\, with penetrating gaze and two attributes -inserted by Transigen company- brings her closer to Mr. Harshness: claws and bad mood. The professor and a fatigued James will undertake a run full of sudden situations in order to safeguard the future defender of humanity: the next X-Men.\n\nImmortality is an entelechy idealized by human beings for human beings\, with the aim of covering manifest fear of senectitude\, or specifically\, death. Not even superhumans of the comics are emancipated from the dogmatic decree of life. Each of the characters from the tight cast faces any problem concerning time\, everything ends with a farewell worn-out stars and unappealable welcome new heroes\, each substance has an expiration date.\n\n17 years. A trilogy. A sequel trilogy. Two spin-offs. A trilogy spin-offs with Wolverine as central star. Of all productions based on Marvel Comics\, X-Men leads on the way for a longer period\, illustrating it (to some extent) to highly prized American superhero genre. Filmic time-line\, with regard to story lines preconceived by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby\, can be abbreviated successfully with three key names: Bryan Singer\, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. Singer recreated for the very first time the story of \""Institute of Xavier for young talents\"" in live-action format; his neophyte hit resulted in his nomination as a director be extended to four feature films focused on the huge franchise. The second one is the lord and master of the school for mutants and\, using brevity\, the official facade of the X - Men saga. The third and last face is who don't play a role\, is who was inserted into it\, a man who metamorphosed his thoughts so that each spectator believed that sharp claws of his hands were coming up\, a man who will be the only Wolverine. According to him\, this movie is the last time that we'll see him as the well-liked character\, in part\, because health conditions of both celebrities have taken their toll on them. Jackman shows us his alter ego drastically unrecognizable: ill\, faint and about to collapse. Australian actor gives everything in order to offer a proper last goodbye his professional epithet\, he provides it tangible malady and visible fatigue along capacities\, his sad gaze captures hopelessness; this man's actions will annoy to ethical heroes world and yes\, what Mangold declared has a voracious source: \""It's not a superhero movie\, it's a film about humans with powers\"". Hugh offers a properly successor\, she is Dafne Keen\, newcomer actress who plays Laura\, an overfilled with anger and vigor girl\, with the potential required to carry upon her shoulder weapon X responsibilities. The dialogs for young actress are quasi-non-existent till the third act of the film\, supplementing that phonetic absence by formidable physical skills within magnetic and violent action scenes; she's the precise Logan counterpart\, as well as a good clone. Although they explicitly mentioned what comic book served as a basis (\""Old Man Logan\"" of Mark Millar and Steve McNiven)\, we weren't expected the way in which certain roles were wiped out\, and though it transmitted an absolute perplexity to audiences\, seems too inhumane even in that context and will cause a non-stop crying to all fan phenomenon. It's something never before experienced in the genre by Marvel\, and isn't necessarily bad.\n\nWolverine's last adventure as an irrevocable spaghetti western is unthinkable\, a feature-film with a dirty and stylized artistic expression and seemingly devoid of moral characters\, rough and badass guys. Here\, the action sequences are justified\, calculated and incredibly ferocious. Officially\, this is the movie adapting Wolvie's pages in form and essence\, it doesn't display super bright battles or with light sparks instead of blood\, violence has a reason and aftermaths; and although the application is concise\, they stir more than Avengers' pompous fights. The signs of summer movie are almost microscopic; the pictures are dry\, pessimistic\, melancholic and without a doubt\, selected components can be compared with \""Midnight Special\"" by Jeff Nichols. All this lack of hope is embellished with a sudden parsimonious pace\, aggressive when it has to be\, but intelligent in emotions posed. Marco Beltrami's music squeezes every means at its disposal\, however\, paradoxically\, calm and sad melodies excel\, they capture the atmosphere of the film.\n\nAnd emotional field matters. Sentimentality is suitable in each character\, sensations are plausible and touch even the most disheartened person. It differs from sporadic determinations\, incomprehensible twists\, every act is motivated by a thought supported by feelings. As it's becoming a road/buddy movie\, interpersonal relationships are improving and wins a brilliantly tremendous connection. Each of these mutant beings has a well-crafted conclusion\, both expected and completely unpredictable endings. In fact\, there's something sad about the movie: this one feels like by far the best Wolvie's story\, making us reflect how other adventures would have been without MPAA restrictions. Must \""Logan\"" thank \""Deadpool\""? It's all in how you look at it\, since even though Wade Wilson's feature film has explicit contents\, everything tends to the wit\, while nuance is different here\, and exactly that's what disquieted 20th Century Fox\, the change has an abrupt alteration in pace with respect to the preceding film\, however\, they can breathe easier now\, money continues coming in.\n\nUnfortunately\, \""Logan\"" must not be perfect thanks to the long- standing quandary which Marvel hasn't been able to keep down: antagonists. Year after year\, movie after movie\, despicable villains have to be as fundamental as setting or leading roles\, they are a key piece in the puzzle\, nonetheless\, \""Logan\"" re-inserted its reluctant hands in the painful ulcer. Perhaps\, the screenwriters and director wanted the star trio was the absolute center of attention\, embedding in the bad-guy role to Pierce (Boyd Holbrook)\, who doesn't appear the time requested on the screen\, a few Mexican police officers and one or two human demons. Another point which many people have reviled is its \""extensive\"" length\, when a film with fascinating components is long? Personally\, it was so enjoyable\, that I didn't even realize the time. Who does check the watch while Mangold directs a car chase (quite comparable to one precise scene in \""The Divergent Series: Insurgent\"") with a convoy at top speed threatening the escapists within a perforated limousine?\n\n\""Logan\"" says goodbye categorically to Bryan Singer's and Mangold's adaptations and takes delighted Christopher Nolan's \""The Dark Knight\"" trilogy aura thanks to its realistic and pessimistic way\, a desolate horizon where the hero isn't super\, is a hero facing human issues. The second R-rated Marvel film cements ambitions in the tone\, script and performances\, portraying fully both the fictional world of the pages as the mortal world\, our world which can transmute in the twinkling of an eye\, there's a dry and overwhelming realism to our uncertain evolution. A violent\, clever and eloquent motion picture; Jackman's final performance gives an unprecedented Wolverine impression so far and offers an open-minded look at the superhero universe\, also serves as confirmation that Marvel can get to be as melodramatic and dark as DC films without losing the skills\, without losing the touch. A round of applause for Hugh Jackman\, who says \""never again\"" to Wolvie's suit\, however\, economic Hollywood can get it. Thank you for everything and good way.

Mad Max: Fury Road(2015) was absolutely mislabelled with an R-rating and it had more grit and grace that could be imagined.  Be gorey now too if you want but the attempt pales in comparison to the more welcomed shocking style of the Green Room(2015).  Your secondary characters were portrayed in highly unrealistic action choreography with mostly undriven motivation.  The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) handled this in a much more exciting manner.

121332,Logan,2017-03-12,2,"First of all\, this is not an X-Men movie. This is a Wolverine movie. Wolverine is a man with an extremely depressing and violent life in which he can't trust anyone\, is always being hunted\, people want to use him\, the people around him get hurt\, and he has to endure physical agony and then come back from it. If you saw a movie like First Class and liked the philosophy\, you won't get that here. This is a movie that seems to be trying to set a world record for how many people's heads it can show being sliced apart. There are also only around three adult mutant characters in this dystopian future.\n\nThis movie's violence makes 300 look PG-13. It's not just violent; it seems to engage in gore porn: it seems to revel in how many times it can make us look at people getting impaled through the leg\, people with gaping bleeding holes\, people's faces as they are undergoing torturous injuries.\n\nThe villains are some combination of the U.S. federal government\, a paramilitary mutant-hating group\, and a biomedical research company that doubles as a weapons contractor\, who for some reason seem to work together in the U.S. and Mexico in a single nearly seamless hierarchy. If you spend the movie wondering whether the soldier-like people Wolverine keeps fighting work for the government\, it's not really any clearer by the end. \n\nHugh Jackman looks ugly in this movie. Wolverine spends the entire movie wincing from injuries. His healing powers only sort of work now\, for some barely explained reason.\n\nI don't think the movie even gives names to all the villains\, so I'll name them myself: Robo-hand\, Dr. Frankenjerk\, and Pulverine. Dr. Frankenjerk is the boss\, but he basically admits in one scene that he's a knockoff version of previous Wolverine adversaries. There is a little ambiguity with this guy about how much of the violence he caused he actually intended\, but he's basically just purely evil like all the villains are shown to be in this.\n\nThere are a few moments when the audience can crack a smile\, when there is a moment of humor when we are eager to get some glimmer of relief from how depressing the rest of it is. For example\, when Charles X sticks out his tongue and makes a sound to taunt Logan and show that he swallowed his pills. Like Logan\, Charles X spends the movie miserable and sick.\n\nWhy do people think this is good? I suppose they like the relationship between Wolverine and the little girl character\, whose story mirrors his. Or they like the scene where Charles X says he finally understands Wolverine\, even though Wolverine never even gets to hear it.

121898,Logan,2017-03-03,5,"For those of you that value my opinion on movies\, even remotely\, just know this: I literally just spent the past ten minutes trying to find something wrong with Logan. For the life of me\, I couldn't do it. If you're reading this and you're in a hurry\, I'll save you some time: Logan is one of the best films you will see all year.\n\nIt's a film that sucks you in with how real it actually feels. Sure\, it takes place twelve years from now and it's about mutants\, yet it still manages to capture a visceral realism that's unforgiving. Mutants\, kids at that\, fighting for their survival and having to take lives to keep their own. Innocent casualties. A corporation willing to risk everything to fatten its own pocket. All conceivable scenarios that gives Logan a roughness around its edges.\n\nThe year is 2029 and there hasn't been a new mutant born since 2004. Logan (Hugh Jackman) has become a limousine driver and his age is finally starting to show. His attempts to remain low-key are ruined when a woman abruptly appears in his life asking him to transport a young girl to safety.\n\nThe film was carried\, in part\, by phenomenal acting performances. Patrick Stewart reprises his role as Professor Charles Xavier. He's become a bit senile in his old age. Logan has to force feed him pills to keep him from having seizures that wreak havoc on the world around him. There's a lot to be said about some of the powerful scenes he finds himself in. There's even more to be said about Dafne Keen's performance as Laura (X-23). Silence is golden for her so she relies a lot on her body language and stoic facial expressions to get her point across. As a fan of the X-23 comics\, I think she did an awesome job of embracing that role. Lastly\, you get to see Hugh Jackman as a Wolverine that you've never really seen before\, but you always knew was there. You can tell he had a lot of fun with this role as he got to utilize a lot of range. He can make you laugh then break your heart\, all within a few moments.\n\nThe action will make your eyes grow big. A lot. Let's just say it's the Wolverine movie everyone has been waiting to see\, or at least the one I've been waiting to see. I won't ruin even the slightest bit\, but lets just say the trailers don't even come close to the bloody flick this film turns out to be. Expect to say \""Ohhhhhh!\"" a lot.\n\nYes\, they got it right this time around. I love that Logan never deviates from character. He doesn't change being who he is just because a kid is in the picture. On the surface\, he's a jerk that has to look out for number one first. Underneath is a man who has a larger heart than he realizes\, yet refuses to show it.\n\nThere's so much more I can say about this film. There's the slightly brilliant move by director James Mangold to not include a post-credits scene (about thirty seconds into the film\, you will understand why and be totally happy about it). Then you have the excellent pacing among many other things. Logan is the overall package.

122063,Logan,2017-03-01,4,"From its very first scene\, we know that Logan is nothing like its predecessors. The first word in the film is \""fuck\"" as Logan awakens\, hungover\, before violently and graphically killing some bad guys who attack him. It's... awesome. Wolverine's character very easily lends himself to the darker\, more cynical tone that Logan takes. He's always been a grouchy recluse\, and it's not at all a stretch to see those traits intensified after the events of his last six years.\n\nSet in the year 2029\, most mutants are gone. Logan lives with the former professor Xavier and another mutant named Caliban. Logan is a limousine driver lured to what he thinks is just another fare. When he arrives\, he finds a woman and a girl\, Laura\, who are being hunted by Dr. Zander Rice and his henchman\, Donald Pierce. After discovering Laura's powers\, identical to his own\, Logan agrees to drive Laura to North Dakota\, where she intends to cross the border into Canada.\n\nHugh Jackman's Logan\, Patrick Stewart's Xavier\, Dafne Keen's Laura and Stephen Merchant's Caliban all benefit from wonderful performances. It was great seeing Merchant do well in such a serious role\, but this is the same character who we saw in X-Men: Apocalypse (though played by a different actor)\, and that film was set in 1983. Logan is set forty-six years later\, and Caliban hasn't aged at all. His makeup is also entirely different\, but I suppose that can be forgiven due to a different crew. Boyd Holbrook and Richard E. Grant do well as Pierce and Rice\, respectively\, but these villainous characters are so shallow in their creation that it's very difficult for either actor to shine.\n\nThis shouldn't be seen as too much of a negative\, though; the bad guys chasing our trio (Logan\, Xavier\, and Laura) could be literally faceless and voiceless without the film losing any of its heart. The good guys are so well-written\, and their relationships so well-fleshed-out that you find yourself even more excited for the quiet\, conversational moments than for the spectacularly gory action sequences.\n\nAs can be expected with any film franchise that's been around as long as X-Men (ten films\, now\, and Jackman/Wolverine has appeared in nine of them - all but Deadpool)\, there are some inconsistencies (yes\, even after Days of Future Past did its little timeline-reset thing) besides the aforementioned Caliban issue. I have a problem with the adamantium bullet\, for one. In X-Men Origins: Wolverine\, Stryker shoots Wolverine in the head with adamantium. Twice. His brain grows back\, but the memories that were there do not\, hence the amnesia (which doesn't make sense in itself\, because he gets the memories back later\, but I digress). In this film\, though\, it's made quite clear that a headshot with an adamantium bullet will result in death.\n\nSpeaking of Stryker\, one of our new baddies\, Rice\, says that his father was the one who put the adamantium into Logan. Logan responds by saying that this is why he killed him. Are they referring to Stryker or to Dale Rice\, Zander's father in the comics? If they're referring to Stryker\, are we supposed to just assume that Logan hunted the guy down and murdered him at some point? The last we saw of him in this timeline was in Apocalypse\, where he was arrested and taken away. Or maybe they're referring to the previous timeline\, but in that timeline Magneto was the one who killed him. If they are referring to Dale\, then\, what\, he was one of the nameless technicians who Wolverine killed in his slightly-more-than-a-cameo scene in Apocalypse? Who the hell cares? Zander's character wasn't nearly interesting enough for us to be interested in an unseen father.\n\nAnd on the topic of adamantium\, how did they get it into Laura? We're told in X2\, and reminded in at least two of the other films\, that it's only malleable in its liquid state\, and that in its cooled\, hardened state\, it's indestructible. This is why it's kept in those vats in the other films. In Logan\, though\, when we see Laura being fitted with her metal endoskeleton\, there is no liquid metal to be seen. And just to rant a tiny bit longer\, how the hell are Laura's bones supposed to grow if they're coated in adamantium? Realistically\, she should be that size forever\, now.\n\nOkay\, that's all of the negatives and tiny frustrations out of the way. The cinematography and direction (James Mangold returns from The Wolverine) are superb. The Wolverine trilogy is strangely unique in that its first film was its worst\, and its third is its best. The Wolverine is much better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine\, and Logan is better still. In fact\, it's the best X-Men or X-Men-adjacent film we've ever had. It's the best superhero/comic-book film since 2012's Dredd\, and certainly the best superhero/comic-book film that 20th Century Fox has ever given us. \""It's very good\"" is what I'm saying.\n\nhttp://alexfalzon.com/logan/",True,0.08101747184991837,0.09327537566423416,0.09225435554981232,0.08021876960992813,0.08056126534938812,0.07817844301462173,0.07680368423461914,0.07887861877679825,0.08637560904026031

126673,Logan,2017-08-16,4,"GREG: (Greg Smith\, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond\, VA) Scott\, didn t I watch this movie in the 70 s when it was Logan s Run?\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison\, Professor of Psychology\, University of Richmond) Greg\, you re confused. This Logan is based on that witty 1960s TV series\, Logan s Heroes. That s my story and I m sticking to it. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re reunited with Logan\, aka Wolverine. It s 2029 and he s been reduced to driving a limousine for fares. The mutant race (and the X-Men) are all but extinct. He is taking what little money he has and is buying prescription drugs from an orderly in the parking lot of a hospital. He takes the pills to an abandoned factory where Caliban\, an albino mutant tracker is tending house. The pills are for Dr. Xavier. He s suffering from dementia. When an episode hits\, it sends out mental shockwaves that paralyzes anyone nearby - to the point of being deadly.\n\nSCOTT: One day Logan is approached by a woman named Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez)\, a nurse who is caring for a  special  set of children. She has one of those kids with her\, an 11-year-old named Laura (Dafne Keen). Gabriela asks Logan to take Laura to a place in North Dakota named Eden\, where Laura will be safe. Logan refuses this request\, but soon changes his mind when Gabriela is killed by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and his men who harbor ill-intentions for mutants like Laura.\n\nGREG: Scott\, Logan is a film for adults more than children. So much so that it is rated  R  by the MPAA. It is darker than most Marvel films as it features more blood and adult language than its predecessors. And I think it makes the film better. Logan deals with existential issues like death\, aging\, and suicide. These are heavy topics for an audience that is often made up of both children and adults. And while the film got an adult rating\, there were many children in the theater that I was in. There is an alternative Logan in this film as well. Dubbed as  X-24  - this is a younger clone of Logan. But unlike Logan\, X-24 is filled with blind fury and does the bidding of the evil Dr. Zander Rice. The special effects here are stunning. We saw this last year in  Captain America: Civil War  where we see a young Tony Stark. The young Logan is a digital creation based on earlier images of Logan from previous films. It s an amazing recreation.\n\nSCOTT: Logan is indeed an impressive movie\, not just in its CGI effects but most notably in the areas of storytelling\, acting\, and character development. It s an X-Men tale surprisingly rich in exploring the nature of these characters\, their history\, and their ever-evolving relationships. This is Hugh Jackman s most complex and effective portrayal of Wolverine. He delivers his best performance as an X-Man\, playing a mutant on a mission who assists another younger mutant on a mission. Going into the theater\, I wasn t expecting a whole lot\, having been less than dazzled by previous installments of X-Men and Wolverine. But Logan moved me. A big reason is young actor Dafne Keene\, whose face can express a thousand emotions and whose overall performance here is astonishingly good. Another shout-out goes to Patrick Stewart whose character is dying yet remains fully committed to educating his students and developing their characters to the very end.\n\nGREG: As a hero\, Logan is great. He is at the lowest point in his life. All his friends are dead and his mentor is dying. He s given a  call to adventure  by Gabriella to take Laura to Eden. And as classic heroes do\, he refuses the call. He doesn t want to get involved. But when Gabriella is killed and Laura follows Logan back to his lair\, he becomes an unwilling guardian of the girl. And we see him come to care about the girl and her friends. Ultimately\, he makes the ultimate sacrifice. And we see a type of hero that we rarely see in movies anymore - the martyr. We saw this in 2013 s Elysium where Matt Damon s character gives his life to save a young girl. There s a danger in creating a martyr - the viewer is walking in the hero s shoes. And when the hero dies\, so does the viewer. So\, when the hero dies it must be for a cause that is greater than himself. And Logan makes that sacrifice. He is the last of the X-Men and he trades his life for a new generation of mutants. It s a worthy sacrifice and one that the viewer can buy into.\n\nSCOTT: Well said\, Greg. Also\, let s not forget that Logan is dying from Adamantium poisoning. Yet he makes sacrifice after sacrifice. This movie really taps into the archetype of the aging\, diminishing hero who is called to muster up his former powers in service of a great cause. It was jolting to see the CGI effect of a younger\, stronger Logan battling his aging counterpart. I continue to be impressed by Marvel s ability to create new compelling variations of the ancient conflict between good and evil. Let s examine the transformations in this film. Logan is physically transformed by the Adamantium\, and Professor Xavier is mentally transformed by his dementia. Emotionally\, Logan transforms from pure bitterness about his plight to developing a caring compassion for the fate of Professor Xavier and the young mutants\, especially Laura. And Laura herself transforms from an angry mute young girl to a vocal\, passionate hero of the mutant cause. With this movie\, Marvel really showcases its understanding of the elements that go into effective hero storytelling.\n\nGREG: Absolutely. Transformation is at the heart of storytelling. Marvel writers understand this and give us stories about people\, relationships\, and how they change. It s a stark difference from what we see coming out of the DC universe. There\, the stories are about special effects and the story falls to the wayside. Marvel gives us both action and transformation. It s a gratifying experience. Logan is a great story told well. We ve come to expect a lot from Marvel films and they deliver. I give Logan 4 out of 5 Reels. As a hero\, Logan steps up to the challenge and shows us how a hero can give his all. I give Logan 4 out of 5 Heroes. And you can t get much better than 3 transformations in one story. As you point out\, Logan\, Professor Xavier\, and Laura all undergo transformations that resonate with the audience. I give them 5 Transformation points out of 5. Movie: Transformation: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Logan is the most compelling installment of the X-Men franchise in many years. The keys to its success lie in a terrific screenplay\, a stronger than usual performance from Hugh Jackman\, a striking performance from newcomer Dafne Keen\, and several powerful transformations among the main characters. The genius of Marvel in understanding heroic storytelling is on full display here. I award this film 4 Reels out of 5. We have a pair of buddy heroes here in Logan and Laura. They are an unlikely pairing and start out disliking and distrusting each other. With mentoring from Professor Xavier\, Logan develops an understanding and appreciation for Laura and her cause. Logan s hero s journey contains all the classic elements\, including a surprise element of the ultimate sacrifice of his own life at the end. Marvel knows that martyrdom is an archetype of deep significance in our culture (Jesus\, MLK Jr\, and Gandhi are notable examples). Laura s journey is also powerfully inspiring. These two heroes earn the full 5 Hero points out of 5. Our two heroes  transformative journeys are emotionally and physically complex\, and satisfying. Logan s emotional growth helps compensate for his physical deterioration. Laura gains courage and develops into a leader of the young mutants. Even Professor Xavier shows heroic courage and grit in fighting his disease and mentoring our heroes. I award this film 4 Transformation points out of 5.

It made me sad. I won't deny\, some scenes made me shiver\, few shots challenged me to hold my tears\, and I left the hall with a broken heart. At the same time\, it made me happy in a strange way. A unique sense of fulfillment was there. This is Logan\, as he was always meant to be: violent\, bestial\, unforgiving yet so much humane and caring. Like he used to say\, \""I'm the best there is at what I do; but what I do isn't very nice.\"" How unapologetically blunt. There is strong gory violence in 'Logan' which makes it an 'R' rated film\, yet there is this unique feeling surrounding the movie which will melt your heart.\n\nSir Patrick Stewart should get an Oscar for his portrayal as Professor X. Like Hugh\, this is his last X-Men appearance. And he nailed it. I don't have the authority to comment on his acting. He's on another level. Hugh Jackman gave us what we fans always dreamt of. The Wolverine - an animalistic Wolverine. We got it in his last movie. Hugh\, we love you. You will always be our Logan. You can never ever be replaced. You won our heart\, Hugh. Now go win an Oscar for this movie. We wish you all the happiness and success in all your future endeavours. And Dafne Keen\, such a sweet little doll! Such a sweetheart! So talented in such a young age... This cutie pie will reach stars in future\, guaranteed. All the very best\, baby.\n\nDirector James Mangold proved numerous times that he's capable of making unforgettable movies. Hopefully this movie will get him the awards he deserved for a long time. Cinematography was top notch. Music was perfect. Take notice WB and Zack Snyder and the team behind DCEU\, this is how you make a dark and gritty movie. Critics don't hate dark toned films. To be praised\, you have to make the story line dark and mature\, you don't just dark the picture quality then make shitty childish movies and demand to be praised. Hopefully the DCEU team will learn from this.\n\nGoodbye James \""Logan\"" Howlett. Our Wolverine. May God bless your tormented soul.

Of course\, what really makes Logan work though is that it has a real human quality to it\, with Hugh Jackman giving his finest performance as the iconic mutant\, and his co-star\, the young Dafne Keen\, gives the child performance to beat for 2017.

127461,Logan,2017-03-13,4,"HELL OR HI\, DAUGHTER - My Review of LOGAN (3 1/2 Stars)\n\nIf you read my reviews with any regularity\, then you already know my profound distaste for all things superhero.  I can only take so many CGI-infested\, nuance-deprived tales of good vs. evil wherein the third act consists of endless fights\, explosions\, and end-of-the-world scenarios.  I just don't care\, and even more importantly\, I never remember a thing about these multiplex seat fillers.  Having said that\, LOGAN\, the latest installment in the WOLVERINE/X-MEN series\, is about as good and as unusual as one of these\, to me\, less than marvelous Marvel movies is going to get\, so I'm giving credit where credit is due here.  \n\nIf you're a fan of ultra violent\, neo-western-noir road movies\, then LOGAN just may bowl you over.  Once again\, Hugh Jackman plays the title character at a juncture in his life where he just wants to hide away from the world.  He's shored up with a very ill Professor X (Patrick Stewart) somewhere in Mexico when trouble in the form of a mysterious\, silent little girl named Laura (Dafne Keen\, and holy sh*t\, more on this amazing talent  in a bit!) upends their isolation by drawing various Big Bads to them.  I won't say more about the story\, but it's not spoiling anything to say that in a film starring Wolverine\, the claws come out.  \n\nLOGAN\, directed and co-written by James Mangold (WALK THE LINE\, GIRL INTERRUPTED\, COPLAND) with additional writers Scott Frank (MINORITY REPORT\, OUT OF SIGHT\, LITTLE MAN TATE) and Michael Green (GREEN LANTERN\, AMERICAN GODS)\, doesn't feel like most comic book extravaganzas.  Fatigue sets the tone in this odd mixture of the world-weary western elements of HELL OR HIGH WATER and the father-daughter road relationship of PAPER MOON.  Yes\, the movie contains almost non-stop action and violence\, but the settings seem gritty and real and the themes of aging and of giving up on life lend the movie more gravitas than one usually experiences with this genre.  These are filmmakers who clearly elevate a genre I despise with adroit characterizations and plenty of grace notes.  \n\nNow about that violence.  It's an assault with more stabbing\, dismemberments and beheadings than any film I can remember.  It's aggressive\, full throttle and seemingly without letup.  Between that and the plethora of needle shots\, I covered my eyes quite a bit.  I haven't felt this pummeled by a film since MAD MAX: FURY ROAD\, which also shares a lot of the same DNA.  Both contain terrific performances and a careful attention to forward momentum.  \n\nYes\, Jackman delivers big time with this angry\, gut-busting primal scream of a performance\, but it's Keen who astonishes.  The earlier reference to PAPER MOON wasn't haphazard\, as this has got to be one of the greatest child performances since Tatum O'Neal won her Oscar back in 1974.  Keen has an incredible presence even when not speaking a word.  So many child actors avoid eye contact with their co-stars and never appear to be listening\, but Keen has a solid\, frightening gaze and when she emotionally lets loose\, it shot right through me.  Although she first appeared in the TV series\, THE REFUGEES from 2014-15\, LOGAN marks her highly auspicious feature debut. \n\nOther notable performances include Stephen Merchant (the UK version of THE OFFICE) Caliban\, a palpably frightened albino\, and Eriq La Salle (ER)\, who does a nice job of sketching in family dynamics in what feels like a mini-movie right in the middle of the story.  Stewart also adds some late-in-life texture to his now-familiar Professor character. Additionally\, Cinematographer John Mathieson\, no stranger to the genre\, must have enjoyed shooting a film that takes place on earth and features great performances.  He also has a field day with the \""seizure\"" sequences\, which also are stunning examples of sound editing and mixing.\n\nAll good\, right?  Well.......ok\, here's where the curmudgeon in me takes over.   \n\nAs I said earlier\, this is as good as these movies are gonna get\, but I won't remember anything about the story and just don't care anymore.  I crave real stories about real people who don't have sharp blades sticking out of their knuckles.  I've got nothing left in my tank for magical powers or energy being harnessed to make things fly in a huge swirly motion. I like real stakes that I can believe in to keep me involved.  Sure\, there's a place for fantasy and mind-bending science fiction\, but when it's the only flavor being offered by the major studios\, it makes me want to concentrate really hard\, harness all of my energy\, and lift them off their foundations and send them crashing into a black hole.",True,0.32736703753471375,0.30889251828193665,0.26216378808021545,0.3047492504119873,0.2758777141571045,0.29313552379608154,0.2817801237106323,0.33283358812332153,0.27727457880973816
127490,Logan,2017-03-05,1,"Here is a movie that so offended me\, I stormed out of the theater 15 minutes before it finished with hot ears. Here is yet another white male hero narrative\, lacking any semblance of a story and compensating instead with testosterone-fueled violence porn. A protagonist with no redeeming personality traits\, whose John-Wayne-esque emotional repression and \""reluctant\"" fixation on violence is somehow supposed to stir a sense of endearment in the viewer. And\, of course\, since he is so burdened by alienation caused by his übermenschian power\, he is driven to self medicate\, and this is supposed to stir sympathy in the viewer.\n\n    Yes\, another white male hero\, who ALONE possesses the strength and power to assist all helpless minority roles cast in the movie. First\, he rescues a little Latina girl but seems to dislike her / barely tolerate her throughout the story. A little Latina girl who is the movie's main female role\, but who is conveniently mute so as not to disrupt the steady flow of testosterone pumping through every intention in plot\, aesthetic and writing duct-taped together to create a mind-numbing sensory overload for anyone who can't get rock-hard on gratuitous violence alone (some of us need a story.)\n\n    Then\, our white male hero meets a black family on the side of the road\, in need of his assistance of course (why else cast black people in a white hero worship movie\, unless they need assistance from our white hero?)\, which he/his sidekick graciously lend. The family invites Hugh Jackman to their home to show gratitude for his help\, where his negligence and violent lifestyle directly lead to the gory massacre of their entire family.

127501,Logan,2017-01-31,5,"Here it is\, Hugh Jackman's final run as one of the most iconic and popular comic book superheroes of all time: Wolverine. After a (very) rough first solo movie\, an alright second solo movie\, and his many\, many appearances in the X-Men franchise\, he finishes with a bang in the form of an action-packed\, emotional\, risk-taking\, unique\, and fantastic superhero film.\n\nLogan tells the story of an aged Wolverine\, who lives on the Texas-Mexican border with a dying Professor X and Caliban (for any of you who remember Caliban from X-Men: Apocalypse\, do not expect the same character). He spends his days drinking and working as a chauffeur to afford prescription drugs for Xavier and\, eventually\, a boat that he can use to retire on. However\, his sad and relatively peaceful life is interrupted abruptly when he is asked to look after a young girl who\, as Xavier says\, is \""very much like\"" Wolverine. And now we have our story. Our magnificent\, gripping story.\n\nFirst of all\, the film benefits from a solid acting cast. Hugh Jackman delivers his best performance as Wolverine yet\, portraying a darker\, gloomier version of the character that possesses the same stubbornness and badassery that we remember from the past. Patrick Stewart delivers another great performance as Professor X\, providing lots of heart\, and a surprising dose of humor\, that balances the overall gritty tone the film conveys. Another standout here is Dafne Keen as Laura (or X-23 to you comic enthusiasts). While her character is mostly silent (with a lot of enraged screaming) throughout the film\, she was casted perfectly to fit her role and provides a LOT of gory action scenes and an emotional touch to the story. The rest of the supporting cast is great as well (except for one particular character who pissed me off\, as I am sure he was meant to)\, and each minor character brings a little something extra to the table. This brings up one of the things that makes the film special: it is driven by characters and focused on characters\, not shouldered along by CGI and overloaded action.\n\nNow\, what makes Logan truly stand out among the many other films in its genre is its tone\, its willingness to take risks that other films would not\, and its exploration of themes that hit the audience in the heart and that can be applied to our own lives. The film is dark and gritty\, which is no surprise\, but something that the story benefits from immensely. There are no happy\, fairy tale endings\, no last-minute \""save-the-day\"" scenarios\, no fixes to every problem that the characters encounter. It is much more realistic in this way\, and therefore much more unique. The film also spends an appropriate amount of time exploring the meaningfulness of family and how that can affect a person's life\, which adds an emotional undertone that you will never see in most action and superhero films. And\, finally\, there's the violence. We've all been waiting for a Wolverine movie that truly shows its claws (pun intended)\, something that the PG-13 rating of the past X-Men and Wolverine films have prevented. However\, the R rating of Logan allowed the filmmakers and actors to not hold anything back. This was something that made a film about a man with adamantium-covered claws shine. And while the gore might be too much for some people\, it fit Wolverine and his story perfectly. This brings me to another brief point in terms of visuals: the cinematography and setting of the film provided gorgeous and wild scenery that also fit the story perfectly. Let's just say that I would LOVE to visit some of the filming locations used for the movie.\n\nLogan acts as the perfect ending for Wolverine's saga. It is dark and gritty\, hearty and emotional\, violent and gory\, action and drama-packed\, gorgeous and wild... all at the same time. This is a character arc that I pray future filmmakers will leave alone to make its mark on cinematic history. Because Logan is\, in my opinion\, one of the best superhero films made\, and one that I will not forget.

128661,Logan,2017-03-06,5,"How does it take 9 movies and 5 directors (no I don't really count Deadpool\, despite it's technical inclusion in this universe) to make something as beloved as Wolverine truly work\, despite a stellar cast\, loads of top notch CGI\, multiple massive budgets\, and most importantly\, a character with as much potential as Wolverine? One can't be sure and sadly\, this will the be the first and last time but thankfully\, Logan is breathtaking. A savagely R-rated masterpiece that spares no gory detail but also manages to be intimate and emotional at the same time\, Logan is a truly unique film\, standing nearly unchallenged with the likes of The Dark Knight and Constantine as thoughtful\, inspired\, and impactful superhero films that manage to spend as much time with inner turmoil and character growth as they do with that slash and smash villain fighting they end up having to do eventually. Not only that\, but Logan is also a deeply risky film on a number of levels. Mangold has no problem degrading our heroes\, bringing them down to our level\, breaking them with their physical torments\, with the weight of years\, of their deeds\, both good and bad. Not only is the movie unafraid to take potshots at beloved characters\, both physically and emotionally\, but the film is also unabashedly political\, a literal middle finger to the new administration and several of its policies. The film revolves around Hispanic refugees fleeing across borders\, escaping from heavily armed bionic mercenaries who might as well be ICE agents or the Border Patrol on steroids. The film's politics aren't quiet in the quieter moments either\, as Mangold takes these times to reflect on corporate greed\, environmental issues\, and government takeover\, all of which are tied up neatly back to our original protagonists. It isn't a subtle message in the slightest but in light of current events\, the movie feels so applicable that unlike something like Arrival\, these politics don't feel forced in the slightest\, a credit to the touch of Mangold here\, who deftly weaves these threads into Logan's road trip story. And that's where another part of the risky business lies. Previous Wolverine films (or movies featuring him)\, have always focused on the slash and smash aspect (particularly Origins\, which abandoned an interesting normal life to devote about 70% of the film to untraceable action)\, the slice em to bits with the giant\, CGI metal claws. Mangold was already trending away from this with The Wolverine (about 30% action) and for good reason. Surprisingly\, despite Wolverine's physical attributes\, it's his emotional battles that have always defined him\, given him meaning and gravity. These come out best when his claws go away and Mangold seems to have caught on to this\, first with The Wolverine and now perfected in Logan\, which is almost entirely devoted to a road trip that is in turn devoted to giving our characters meaning and depth. Professor X\, only a supporting character here (although Stewart too has announced that this will be his last turn)\, is fleshed out more thoroughly than in any other film. The wonderful\, starmaking find of Dafne Keen adds wordless drama\, tension\, and dark humor to every shot as we get to see her discover childhood for the first time. And most importantly\, we see Logan rage with himself\, with Xavier\, and playfully\, with Laura as he struggles with what he has been grasping so desperately at for 9 films. It's heartbreaking to watch and it's so clear that Mangold and Jackman are committed to ending this thing now\, properly\, as it should be. But it is so worth it. Logan is the indie film of the X-Men universe\, perhaps the only film that will ever have a shot at the Oscars and fittingly so\, for these two great stars on their final run together. In an incredible conflux of the entertainment\, politics\, and culture\, Logan has emerged as a one-of-a-kind polished gem.

The mutant population has practically been wiped out with Logan living a simple life in Mexico with old pal Charles Xavier (Stewart) and the albino mutant Caliban (Merchant). Both Logan and Charles have seen better days. Charles suffers multiple seizures and no longer has full control over his mind.

As hard as Logan tries to ignore them\, he finds himself caught up in their mess. Charles believes little Laura has gifted powers\, and after an all-out brawl at their compound\, Logan learns she is full of the same metal that fills his body. She was born in an experimental lab where mutant children were created to become killing machines. Logan and Charles find themselves on the run protecting this little girl from the authorities that are fast on her trail.\n\nIt can be a bit hard to keep up in the lineage of two X-Men trilogies and a Wolverine trilogy. The other Wolverine movies were grave disappointments and X-Men: Apocalypse was overstuffed with characters and CGI to the point it ruined the set-up previously in place for that second trilogy. It was a relief to sit through Logan and realize that Jackman is ending his run on a high note. This film is not only the best in his standalone trilogy\, but is one of the best of the nine movies. Director James Mangold\, who also directed The Wolverine\, keeps the movie as grounded in realism as possible. It's an added challenge\, but one that ultimately works\, when a director can morph the lore of the genre while keeping it in tangible and realistic society. He goes back to basics to remind us why we like this character. His fills his screenplay with great care fleshing out where these characters are at as we approach the end of their journey. I think naming it Logan showcases how Mangold is diving into the human side of him now\, not just the X-Men mutant that he was once. He was a brutal independent tough guy with claws of steel. He still has that edge\, but now we find him in the caretaker role to his mentor Charles and Laura. There is a strong family theme to this film that's been missing in the other Wolverine movies. It raises the stakes for these three characters as we see them potentially facing their end of days.\n\nDespite it being set in the near-future\, Mangold feels inspired by the western genre to close out this iteration. There is the obvious desert wasteland setting\, it's survival of the fittest mode\, and the final epic showdown for our hero. He even uses Johnny Cash's \""The Man Comes Around\"" to play during the closing credits. It's the perfect touch to define one of the most popular X-Men characters. Even if you've never seen any of the other entries\, Logan has it's own standalone story. At the same time\, Mangold keeps it in tune with what has come before for us geeks that have devoted seventeen years to the character. Charles and Logan reminisce about the old days detailing key moments in previous films. There's also the meta vibe in acknowledging the impact the X-Men had in society. Logan comes face to face with the Wolverine action figure in the full yellow suit and the comics that have been made detailing their adventures.\n\nLogan succeeds at never feeling bogged down in cheap CGI effects like some superhero movies tend to rely on. There are long bouts where the claws are kept in as Mangold focuses on the relationships between the three main characters. When the time comes for Logan's and Laura's claws\, he goes full force. This film was given the creative license for a hard-R rating given the previous success of Deadpool. The violence and carnage is cranked up much higher than in the previous films. It feels appropriate given the nature of these characters and that it's the last movie. This is definitely NOT a kid's movie with the profanity and brutality at hand. It's especially jarring at times given the fact that the young girl is extremely ruthless.\n\nIt's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Wolverine\, yet Jackman was the second choice. Dougray Scott was originally cast but had to back out due to scheduling conflicts with Mission Impossible II. Jackman brings out more layers to Logan than we have seen in any of the previous entries. His scenes with Patrick Stewart have a heartfelt father/son quality to them\, which gives the film more weight as it progresses. You don't often find that in your standard superhero film. As a kid growing up watching the X-Men cartoons\, Logan is the ending I was hoping for unlike X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: Apocalypse. The conclusion to a trilogy needs give a proper sendoff to characters we have come to love and root for. Logan does precisely that as I grew to really care about him as a person. Maybe I can revisit the other two in this trilogy with a better appreciation.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? An extremely satisfying conclusion for such a beloved character\n\nRATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",True,0.10290959477424622,0.0960586667060852,0.053333137184381485,0.07936430722475052,0.10006988048553467,0.09044723957777023,0.06208530068397522,0.09261751174926758,0.06311950087547302

128996,Logan,2017-03-13,5,"Hugh Jackman launched his American acting career as Logan back in the year 2000 when the very first X-Men hit.  Nearly 17 years later\, he has now called it a wrap on a character it feels nobody else has the right to touch.  In the coup de gras\, \""Logan\""\,  Jackman puts forth the best performance of his career on the silver screen as the adamantium-filled mutant\, Wolverine\, in the best offering the franchise has given us to date.\n\nLet's take a step back and thank Deadpool first.  Getting the rated 'R' tag for a hero such as Wolverine was a godsend for the send off.  Certain characters in the comic world deserve this\, and Logan/Wolverine might be the most deserving next to Deadpool.  There was no negative to allowing director James Mangold or Jackman to go full throttle with the character in their final pitch\, and quite frankly\, I don't see how this movie gets made without it.\n\nAll this does is make the movie more violent\, suspenseful\, real\, heartfelt\, and intimidating.  It starts out with a fight at a gas stop near the border of Mexico where Logan has turned into some sort of limo driver strapped for cash in the year 2029\, a handful of years into the future where mutants are nearly extinct.  No true explanation comes to us as to why this is the case considering I thought the bloodline was saved in Days of Future Past.  The only real knock to Logan has to be its inability to give some background information to this or a few other events we learn of like the Westchester Event with Charles.  While I am always against exposition told rather than shown\, I suppose it at least doesn't detract from the main point of THIS story rather than making the entire movie about the mutant race rather than Logan\, which is really why we have come to theater.  The only other nitpick has to be a noticeable slowdown in the storytelling about 90 minutes in before the final act.  The healing of Logan has slowed to a crawl with his health failing\, but that shouldn't mean the movie needs to suffer.\n\nOtherwise\, Logan offers up the best of the X-Men Universe to us.  Not only does Jackman deliver us a storied performance as Wolverine his last time out\, but Patrick Stewart puts in equal good work as Professor Charles Xavier.  At over 90 years old and suffering from seizures and illness that result in catastrophic results for everyone around him\, Xavier is more of a threat than ever before.  The relationship between Charles and Logan has always been father/son\, so it's no surprise this movie continues the trend as we meet X-23\, Logan's supposed daughter and proof that mutants aren't quite as extinct as we thought.\n\nDafne Keen deserves some praise as Laura (X-23).  She is ferocious\, quick\, and violent as she slowly learns to develop outside of the environment she was raised in.  Stephen Merchant gave us a brief glimpse at Calaban\, the famed albino tracker\, and Boyd Holbrook\, from Narcos\, was as vile as they come for lead henchman Pierce.  Though Dr. Rice was noted as the main villain\, Holbrook stole the show from his with infinitely more screen time.  Richard E. Grant certainly breathed evil as the scientist working on the mutant children\, but it was mostly everyone else doing the work for him rather than him being a true threat.\n\nOverall\, we got to see exactly what Wolverine (and X-Men) fans have been wanting from the beginning: blood spilled from the hands of the groups most famous hero.  The fight scenes are well choreographed.  The sound effects are pinpoint.  The claws have become the thing we look forward to the most\, and Jackman's portrayal of Logan's rage has become a focal point of his ability.  Limbs (and heads) go flying and blood is definitely spilled by the bucket full.  It's glorious action expanded on by the new inclusion of X-23 and a few other surprises along the way.  \n\nLogan represents yet another installment in the Marvel franchise that succeeds because the studio has finally unlocked the chains that held previous titles back.  They let the Wolverine free\, and everyone is better off for it.",True,0.21803174912929535,0.2261834591627121,0.17938078939914703,0.20592686533927917,0.19641771912574768,0.20931777358055115,0.17515987157821655,0.23026736080646515,0.20788685977458954

129002,Logan,2017-11-02,5,"Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as the iconic grizzled mutant with a tough and nuanced performance in a gritty yet surprisingly thoughtful comic book film that refuses to abide by genre conventions that arises to become one of the best. As mentioned above\, Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine is easily his best yet in Logan\, showcasing the mutant's usual burst of anger and resentment yet here he also successfully conveys the sense of bonding and caring that the mutant at first rejects but begins to accept as the film unfolds in an authentic yet intense matter. His character undergoes significant changes in the film and the actor delivers this well with a complex and layered performance. No less for wear is Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles\, whose performance is also a career best for the actor. Its not just the frail and downbeat and subtle hints and illness of the character but the many layers of grit and humor that the actor balances so well in his performance. Rounding them off is Dafne Keen's surprisingly solid performance as X-23. While she doesn't talk all that much\, she manages to prove quite the threat and danger in the film and the actor is more than up to par. The only downfall\, in terms of the characters is that the film has uninteresting villains. The actors do fine in their roles themselves\, especially Grant\, but he's gone for so long that his villain dosen't matter in the end. However the film does such an intense study of its protagonists that it hardly even matters. The plot offers a more realistic and nuanced take on the Old Man Logan story that fits great within narrative constraints. It successfully blends western elements and typical hero elements for a film that thoughtfully investigates the conditions of human illness while all being grounded down by its sense of humanity. Ultimately it does lose its steam by its final act\, mostly because its runtime ends up showing and the third act is a tad insane\,but it can't ruin all of what came before. James Mangold's direction is excellent\, opting for a more nuanced take on an iconic tale and going for a more mature and grisly drama that coaxes on the strengths of its characters while blending drama and noir elements in good fashion. The film is full of emotion\, to the point where it can become an almost relentlessly somber and gritty tale but its also hopeful and its dark themes are balanced well with its more light sense of humor. The fight choreography is fluid and fully takes advantage of its R rating to deliver the Wolverine film fans always wanted and delivering all the visceral goods but its also balanced with an intelligence that lends its action scenes true weight. The visuals are beautiful and the cinematography fully encompasses the experience\, bathing it in shades of light that more resemble a western film the. anything and makes it feel distinct from other films in the genre. Logan refuses to play by standard comic book film conventions and as a result\, delivers one of the more thoughtful\, unique\, and uplifting comic book films in recent memory or even all time. -",True,0.617991030216217,0.5889678597450256,0.5940631031990051,0.6049208045005798,0.5598735809326172,0.6061620712280273,0.5735920071601868,0.6127777099609375,0.5738852620124817

129008,Logan,2017-03-05,5,"Hugh Jackman pulls out the claws one last time for \""Logan\"" which promised and delivered a much more violent and different feeling superhero film. We get more of a somber tone with elements of a coming-of-age and parenthood film. The violent and gore is in full force. There's plenty of blood and some gruesome deaths that well deserves its R rating. Patrick Stewart also returns and is quite loony and even a bit salty\, he's obviously having a good time but knows how to handle a serious moment. New comer Dafne Keen as Laura is good and may have a bright future in Hollywood if she plays her cards right. And\, of course\, Hugh Jackman as Logan is the best. His near 20 years of playing the character hasn't let us down yet and will be sad to never see him dawn the claws again.

129010,Logan,2017-03-02,4,"Hugh Jackman said in an interview that the R-rating has less to do with the violence\, which\, obviously is in there\, but more with the maturity of the story. And it's true. It's a raw and unfiltered look at weathered and weary superheroes. Professor X is literally and figuratively out of his mind\, and the titular Logan (or Wolverine)\, is after all those years of fighting a mentally\, physically and emotionally broken person. There is a lot of cursing and banter between those two\, which at times is very humorous\, but it mainly shows that they have seen better days\, and now just want to be left alone. Which\, of course\, won't happen\, as soon as the old mutants are involuntarily joined by Laura\, who has special powers of her own and bad people are looking to get her back. For the sake of not spoiling anything for anyone\, who hasn't read a lot or seen the trailers\, I will leave it at that. \nSo for the rest of the movie\, the unlikely trio is on a sort of road trip trying to escape the clutches of some bad folks. \n\nThanks to the R-rating\, we can finally see an unleashed Wolverine\, when he has the power to do that\, and director James Mangold doesn't hold any punches in terms of blood\, gore and decapitation. It's almost refreshing to see what should've been standard years ago. Thanks\, Deadpool!\n\nThe villains of this movie are on the other hand not really that impressive or compelling\, especially if you have a talented actor like Boyd Holbrook as the main antagonist\, who is trying to take Laura. But then again\, this is not so much about good guys (X-Men) fighting against bad guys like Magneto. The main focus of this movie is more about the people\, who have been through a lot of shit and now desperately try to live in peace and savor the rare moments of friendship and family. The bad guys are just a means to shatter those moments\, as soon as they take place. And it's heartbreaking to see. \n\nHugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart know their characters inside out by now\, but they are still doing a fantastic job of portraying a darker and more human side of their characters. Something we haven't seen before. Also Dafne Keen as Laura\, is great. In one moment she is like a normal kid\, but in another she can be a lot more menacing than the people\, who are trying to capture her. There is one character though\, that could've been taken out completely\, in my opinion. The movie already is over two hours long\, so with him cut out\, the movie could've had a slightly better pace.\n\nAlso the special effects sometimes are quite bad and obvious\, but since the movie doesn't really to heavily on them\, it's not huge deal. The make up and costume design though is top notch. There are a few close ups of Wolverine\, where we can see how really\, really broken and messed up this guy is. Gray hair\, bloodshot eyes\, grim features - the whole fucked up deal.\n\nAfter 17 (!) years of portraying this character\, 'Logan' is a brutal and fitting end to Jackmans Wolverine. It's less of a comic book movie\, as we usually see them\, and more of a deeply emotional drama with some heads getting decapitated along the way.

129037,Logan,2017-03-07,4,"Hugh Jackman Takes The Last Stand As The Wolverine in 'LOGAN'.\n\n'LOGAN' Movie Review\n\nYou know something; time really does fly by when you're not thinking about it. It feels like just the other day the year 2000 was here. In the year 2000\, we saw the birth of Britney Spears with \""Oops!...I Did It Again\""\, the fear of Y2K\, crop tops and low - rise pants for women\, and spiked bleached hair for boys and men. \n\nI remember those days. The days of playing video games on PlayStation 2\, putting batteries in my CD player and Game Boy\, and sh*tting my baggy pants. All at the beautiful age of 45. I'm just kidding. To be honest\, I don't remember much about this era\, because I was only six years old at the time. \n\nI'll tell you what I do remember though. I remember seeing the kickoff of the big budget superhero film genre. I remember being a little kid with my parents at the theater. I remember the kick off of the X- Men film franchise. \n\nThe X - Men film franchise has had a total of 10 movies.\n	X - Men (2000)\n	X2: X- Men United (2003)\n	X - Men: The Last Stand (2006)\n	X - Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)\n	X - Men: First Class (2011)\n	The Wolverine (2013)\n	X - Men: Days of Future Past (2014)\n	Deadpool (2016)\n	X - Men: Apocalypse (2016)\n\nAnd now the 10th film in the franchise\, Logan. And that's not all. Studios are still planning Deadpool 2\, another X - Men film (possibly a spin off)\, and they have a spin off television series called Legion\, that follows the son of Professor Xavier. So overall\, these mutants have been pretty damn busy the last few years. \n\nThe film franchise has been known for always having a PG -13 rating. That was until Deadpool came out and was Rated R. That is when studios realized that certain superheroes can be Rated R and still make money and loved by fans. That is why Logan took a risk and is Rated R in a PG - 13 franchise.\n\n I use to tell people that before the X - Men film franchise begun\, before being Rated R was cool\, there was another Marvel superhero film that was Rated R\, called Blade. As much as I love that movie\, I can now see where other people are coming from. They are stating that it was Deadpool\, a property that was already attached to a mainstream franchise\, that was deeply rooted in PG - 13 territory. So some people see Deadpool as 20th Century Fox opening the door for Logan. \n\nIn this film\, Wolverine...actually let me stop there. He is no longer going by the name Wolverine. He is a man now\, an old man\, he is old man Logan. \n\nLogan is directed by James Mangold (The Wolverine). It's set in the future\, where mutants are very rare in society. In the future\, where a weary\, old\, depressed\, Logan (Hugh Jackman) takes care of an ill Professor X (Patrick Stewart) in Mexico. Logan wants to hide from the world\, until a young mutant arrives. A young mutant that is wanted by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook). This young mutant\, Laura a.k.a X -23 (Dafne Keen) is the daughter of Logan. The professor and Logan want to get X -23 to a safe haven for mutants called Eden\, before Pierce gets a hold of her\, and uses her for a dark plan.\n\nHugh Jackman has also stated that this is his last portrayal\, his last stand as the iconic comic book character Wolverine. Which for me\, he will always be Wolverine. He can sing and tap-dance all he wants on Broadway. I'll be that one guy in the crowd yelling\, \""Bring out the claws\, bub!\"" \n\n Now you have 20th Century Fox taking a huge risk with not only this character\, but with this franchise as well. If you are thinking that you are getting another comic book movie that follows the same pattern as the others. Believe me\, you are getting something new and refreshing in the superhero/comic book genre. This is something the genre has been needing for a long time. \n\nOne of the many problems people\, including myself\, had with the last X - Men movie\, X - Men: Apocalypse\, was it was more of the same. I did enjoy that movie; on the other hand\, I do believe it is one of the weaker films in the series. \n\nMainly because it is the whole generic bad guy\, and the good guys will win. When the most exciting thing about an X - Men film is Olivia Munn jumping into the air\, and slicing a car in half with her swords\, I think you may have a problem. \n\nI also feel like this film is even telling the audience on screen that this is not a typical superhero film. In the film\, Logan picks up an X - Men comic book\, he talks about how this comic book isn't like us\, and it didn't happen like this.\n\nIn this world\, even though he is Wolverine\, everything that made him Wolverine is fading away. His claws don't come out like they use to\, he is weary\, sick\, he doesn't heal as fast as he use to\, the other members of the X - Men are dead\, and he is ready to sail off into the sunset. \n\nThese films usually deal with mutants. However\, this is the most human movie in the history of the series. This film pulls back on budget\, GGI\, and really gives the best character driven film in the franchise.\n\nThis is honestly the most depressing film in the series. It's almost like this film doesn't even like their main character. It's sad to see what Wolverine has come to. He saved the world\, has traveled back in time\, and has been a hero for people and mutants. Now he is miserable\, sick\, has thoughts of suicide\, he is dirty\, and he has a job as a limousine driver\, driving teenagers to prom. \n\nIt's like calling an Uber one day\, and a rusty old car comes pulling in and it's a big name celebrity. \""So Idris\, are researching a character for a future role as an Uber driver?\"" Idris\, \""Yeah\, I'm researching on Google Maps where you need to go!\"" \n\nAlso\, the professor once was a wise man\, giving words of wisdom\, and trying to create peace for both humans and mutants. Now\, he yells\, acts crazy\, and much like Wolverine\, it is sad to see what he has become. Even though later on in the film\, he reconnects with Logan\, and his true self/purpose.\n\nAccordingly\, this movie is Rated R with a purpose. It isn't Rated R to show you more guts\, more blood\, more profanity and more nudity. It's not like the \""Rated R\"" version of Batman v Superman. Where Batman drops an F - bomb just because. To me that is not really being edgy or taking a chance. Taking a chance is making a project Rated R to challenge the characters morals\, have character development\, and go in a new direction for a story. Which this film does wonderfully.\n\nThis movie is more of a drama\, but this movie has a lot of action to. When Wolverine goes berserk\, I'm telling you\, that son of a b*tch goes berserk\, buck wild\, and he loses his mind!\n\nClaws exit out of people's faces\, skulls\, and this is the most brutal I've seen Wolverine. X - 23 is also a real hardcore bad ass as well. Sometimes she out shines Wolverine in the fight scenes. \n\nShe is only eleven in the movie\, but she is a great actress. Most of the time she stays quiet. She has to show us her feelings through facial expressions\, which she captures those emotions very well. When she does speak\, both English and Spanish\, you can tell she is delivering her lines with passion. She has so much emotional weight to carry\, and for this little girl it seems like the weight wasn't too heavy. She also has some funny scenes as well. \n\nIs this Movie an Adaptation of the Old Man Logan Comic Series?\n\nNo. I love the Old Man Logan comics that Mark Millar (Wanted\, Kick - Ass) created. If you are coming into the movie thinking you are getting that comic in a movie\, unfortunately you aren't.\n\nThe only similarity between the comic book and this movie is that Wolverine is old. \n\nThe End of an Era for the X - Men?\n\nAs much as I loved the series\, I do not think this will be the last of these mutants. Even though this movie ended so beautifully\, it wouldn't bother me at all if this was the last film in the franchise. I love the way the film ends. Even though it was a little depressing\, it was a nice send off for Jackman\, it ended where if the movies want to\, they can possibly create a spin off\, and it seemed to put everything to rest in positive way. \n\nIs this my favorite X - Men movie? Well it depends on how you look at it. It is my favorite character driven movie of the series. But my favorite movies in this franchise are still X2 and X - Men: First Class.\n\nI do believe the villain is a little weak\, and when the villain creates someone with Wolverine likeness to fight off against the real Wolverine\, I feel like that was a little flat. Personally\, I would have liked to see Saber tooth come back. \n\nThe movie has well developed characters\, it's a change in the genre\, it's action packed\, funny\, and it's a perfect send off for Jackman. Thank you Hugh. I believe Logan earns a...\n\n4 out of 5!\n\nThat being said\, thank you all for reading and or viewing\, and I hope you all have an Xcellent day as always. :)\n\nP.S.

130190,Logan,2019-01-12,4,"I confess that I haven't seen many superhero films (including none of the X-Men films that I can recall) but this recent Hugh Jackman Wolverine film got such positive reviews that it attracted my attention. So\, bear in mind that I watched this cold\, without much awareness of the X-Men backstory (apart from anything I may have gleaned from looking at other kids' comics during summer camp in the 1970s) - your mileage may vary.  Of course\, setting aside some of the supernatural elements\, the film can be read as the story of an aging and disillusioned man\, potentially dying of some unknown illness\, drowning himself in drink and drugs\, but then called upon to assist in a moral imperative whereupon he rediscovers an important part of himself and/or his deeper values.  This may not be Joseph Campbell's hero's journey but it is certainly a story arc we have seen before.  The fact that it is a child who brings the hero to his senses is also familiar.  So\, adding the supernatural elements to the mix may be what has refreshed it.  In this version\, the weary old man (Logan; Hugh Jackman) has razor sharp adamantium claws and the young child is a new mutant developed from his genetic material (played by Dafne Keen) who sports the same weapons.  She has escaped from the facility that created her (run by Richard E. Grant) and needs Logan to help her to escape to \""Eden\"" located on the Canadian border.  It is a long way from the Mexican border - especially with X-Men leader Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)\, now 90 years old\, and experiencing seizures that can kill others\, in tow.  There are some military-styled bad guys to fight along the way and the film earns its R-rating for violence.  The final fight\, in a North Dakotan forest reminiscent of the setting (and moves?) for the Six Million Dollar Man vs. Bigfoot\, feels old-school rather than CGI\, which I appreciated. And it was hard not to identify with a grumbly superhero who wears reading glasses!

Only reason I gave 5 because that's seems to be what everyone else is giving it and if you are reading this then the 5 stars caught your attention. So lets \""Review\"" Logan.\n\nSo when I said \""I have no idea how to review this film\"" I meant it\, I simply cannot rate this film\, not because I was disappointed with it or because It's the best movie in the history of movies. No I can't rate it because I haven't been so emotionally conflicted with something like this since the ending of \""The Last of Us\"" and putting it bluntly this is actually the closest and best film we've had at conveying the same bleak and gritty themes and damn right gut wrenching \""Action\"" in what is arguably the best X-men film and without a doubt the best performance Hugh Jackman has ever given in his career....(Damn that was long)\nDespite reoccurring characters and Easter Eggs\, make no mistake if you go in this film expecting an X-Men movie then chances are you will be disappointed. I think everyone in the cinema was just as conflicted as I am as I found myself awkwardly applauding when the truth is this is not a film to be applauded at. The truth is it was my weird way of saying goodbye to Hugh Jackman as Logan\, a character I have grown up with for 16 years even though my childhood fantasies made me choose Storm over all the other superheroes. It wasn't until Wolverine and after going back to X2 that I realized just how brilliant Logan was as a character\, and everything he's been through is put on display for what I can only call a fucking awesome and hard hitting movie.\n\nWhether this is really an X-Men movie or another Wolverine movie is just as debatable as where does Rogue One belong in the Star Wars saga and I'm going to say what I just said in my Anime review 20 minutes ago. WHO THE FUCK CARES?! The performances in this movie alone should get recognized for Oscar nominations and if only the \""Part of the saga: X-men\"" wasn't written on this damn critic site then it would genuinely have a pretty good shot at winning it for best actor Hugh Jackman\, best support actor Patrick Stewart and best rising star for Dafne Keen. Its so rare seeing performances like this in Saga based movies and it's entertaining just for that alone even with Oscar season over. \n\nFor a character who can heal from almost anything\, this movie did something that I never thought was possible with Logan. I was scared. Scared of what would happen to him both physically as he is constantly torn apart and emotionally for the damaged shell of a man he has become. It's no wonder with the things he's been through the situation is as grim as it is. You feel every ounce of intense and damn hard to watch action that hits the screen\, it's R rating is something fans have been dying to see and it works just so damn well here. It never pushes it's boundaries to ridiculousness like with Deadpool as humorous as that was\, it's ruthlessness is pushed ever more with the insane brutality that is thrown at by the introduction of Child mutant Laura who Is just bad ass when she is not showing her surprising emotional child side (This is not a world for Kids as this film shows). \n\nNow of course I had high expectations for this film\, which is something I really wish I could avoid since there were points where I was disappointed or wished they could have added important scenes in\, or bits that simply didn't hit me as emotionally as I wanted it too most likely because of how numb this film made me feel from the violence. I was even pissed off at points where the film completely fails to explain pretty much anything\, if you hate plot holes you will hate this film. I even found myself disappointed with the soundtrack to the film something I rarely even consider\, but when you have 3 amazing songs which perfectly express the tone of the film in their respective trailers and have nothing even close to that in the actual film. Instead outside of action it's entirely silent all the way through\, but since the silence subtlety conveys the tone of the film regardless I can't exactly argue against it. Like I said a film cannot please everyone and with the way certain character arcs are portrayed throughout the movie hence my inevitable \""Nostalgia Critic\"" kicks in and I can't help but think just how shitty some things were and how it sacrifices entertainment for slow character. Yet this is also where \""Emotional Conflict\"" also kicks in because as much as I hate to admit this film is brilliant at making you give a fuck only for something unexpected and more than unpleasant to happen\, and if you have been paying attention to my rambling then you should realize where this movie is going and it's damn right shit. And I mean that in both the worst and best of ways.\n\nLook if you've made it this far or just decided to skip to my conclusion (Then you are missing out on some serious dry and awful humour) my rating is this. I don't have one. The only thing I can say is that this is the best send off to Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart\, the best send off I've seen in all my years of watching movies. It earns it's place AS A DAMN GOOD MOVIE and every tear that my friends shed throughout watching it.

132327,Logan,2017-03-02,5,"If there was a standard in films it's the unwritten rule (that was dropped in last years X-Men: Apocalypse) that the third film of a franchise is always the worst. No franchise has ever been able to break away from this tradition. I never thought I would see anything like that and that's why I'm a little bit shell shocked right now at how great a film Logan happens to be. This film is a revelation\, an oasis in a desert of the tried and true comic book movie formula. Like last years Deadpool\, Logan breaks the conventions and succeeds at several levels.\n\n\nThe year is 2029 and Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a chauffeur\, saving up his dollars to buy a boat and live out his days on the high seas. Mutants are all but extinct with Logan having a safe house across the border in Mexico with a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and albino tracker Caliban (Stephen Merchant) caring for the professor while Logan is away driving prom dates and bachelorettes around in the wee hours of the morning. When a woman mysteriously tracks Logan down and asks for help in taking a young girl named Laura (Dafnee Keen) to \""Eden\""\, a sanctuary for mutants that gets them into Canada and safety. They need Logan's help because they are being pursued by Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and the corporation that has managed young Laura since her birth.\n\n\nDirector James Mangold almost had it with The Wolverine\, but that film derailed in its last 20 minutes. With Logan he makes it to the finish line with a film that isn't all about explosions and flashy costumes. The film takes a swipe at the comics that furnished the characters and how ridiculous the stories contained within them. Logan is a character piece expanding between generations and the passing of the torch that occurs in our lives. Both Logan and Xavier are old and beginning to feel the pains associated with aging\, like we all do. Jackman is Wolverine and always will be\, but he goes beyond the typical Bub and one liners by bringing a raw emotion to the tole that hasn't been there before. The breakdown of everything he once had has worn him down along with time. The rest of the cast holds up to the subject matter that is well written and doesn't play the audience like idiots. As a story the film does take pieces from the graphic novel Old Man Logan\, but has managed to break it down into something else\, partly out of storytelling (where it succeeds) and partly out of not having access to all of the pertinent characters. \n\n\nThis is the movie Marvel wishes it could be. This is the movie DC once was (The Dark Knight). A gritty and realistic take on super heroes without the other worldly components. Logan is a film that borrows more from the western genre than the comic books where the characters were born. Shane is referenced heavily in this film as a man resists going back to what he once was only to be pulled back to it like the tides. Nature will always push you there. Logan and Shane are men cut from the same cloth. Add in the feel of The Searchers and you get a film that feels epic without blowing up a city. You just blow up someones life. If only other comic book films could be more like Logan and less like disaster porn. Where Stephen Spielberg compared comic book films to the westerns of old\, Logan has embraced that identity fully. Films like this will keep the genre alive.\n\n\nMy son turned 16 a few months back. Thinking back tonight I realized that in all the franchises out there Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is the only consistent throughout his life. The actor and the character have become synonymous with each other and the idea that the next time you see that character on screen played by someone else is a heartbreaking proposition. I can only compare it to Christopher Reeve as Superman for me (By the time I was 20 we had had 3 Batmen) and the attempts to recast that role in the years since have always led me to the finally verdict that \""they were OK\, but they aren't close to Reeve's Superman\"". Call it nostalgia or whatever\, but that's what we have to face now. Hugh Jackman has (supposedly) stepped down from a wonderful run\, though it had some low spots\, he played the role with a relish rarely seen in today's franchised film world. Logan is a wonderful (possible) swan song for the man that has given us the original anti-hero in comic book cinema. We will all miss his take on the character and the permanent mark he has made on super hero films. This generation of the genre ultimately started with him and Logan manages to be the best super hero film I've seen in close to a decade.",True,0.06231207400560379,0.06344006955623627,0.04407884553074837,0.05084315314888954,0.05725150182843208,0.05686604976654053,0.0491599403321743,0.08094888180494308,0.04920263960957527

132835,Logan,2017-03-05,4,"If you think\, that MCU's started quiet a long time ago\, think again and look at Hugh Jackman\, who's been playing Wolverine for more than 17 years - symbolic that his character's more than hundred years old. But this long run's come to an end\, but what kind of it? The end we all dreamed of - brutal and enjoyable franchise's epilogue with both dramatically and action satisfaction. \n\nHugh Jackman's brilliant smile has passed away\, Logan's grown some hairs and accepted hobo-style look - in the world of familiar comic book adaptations\, such approach is really welcomed\, especially in Wolverine's case\, who's iconic and original image of severe killer was long-awaited by the fans and average viewers. Costumes and shining setting are gone\, substituted by dystopic and urban landscapes\, which're perfectly matches title character's inner world - broken and hopeless. Frankly\, dark tone makes old and new heroes or villains look more mature and conversations between Stewart's and Jackman's aged Professor Xavier and Logan come to a new level from just professional to more family-style. Of course\, it's more because of wow-effect from new conception either from real franchise drama-development\, but still it's really cool. Especially\, considering the fact that actors give fine performances of their characters\, especially Boyd Holbrook\, whose vicious Donald Pierce is the best villain in years. Even Dafni Keen's character isn't annoying at all\, as it may concern previously. She' isn't much talking anyway\, what's a really smart move from creators.  \n\nDirector James Mangold's new entry in comic genre includes high-stakes filming and the viewers are also now more demanding here and although he's made a great job in style and concept\, scenario has some significant flows. Yes\, we have a minimum world description for comfort viewing\, which includes automatic wagons and some new technologies descriptions\, but the story background lacks of information - Mangolg gives only glimpses of what happened\, why and how characters ended like this. This may upset some hardcore fans as well as universe development's pretty weak with the feeling that film in every way tries to stay from X-Men franchise. However\, the real concern about director's work is movie's rough final act - after emotional and thoughtful main part ending feels like director\producer came out on the stage and said \""we run out of time/budget and have to end this drama with typical superhero sequence\"". Make no mistake\, it's not as bad as you may think\, the problem isn't so big\, as it was in previous Wolvie movie\, where after well-done narration has come a silly finale\, but still it's a bit upsetting. But nevetheless\, even considering this issues \""Logan\"" is a great story with complex characters and may be ranked as step forward for comic book movies with the chance\, that in future we will get more adult-style adaptations with both satisfying dramatic and action features.   \n\n\""Logan\"" is barely can be named as a revolution in genre\, but it's a great example of a thoughtful storytelling combined with terrifying action-sequences - script issues can be easily forgiven\, given the fact\, that the major part is really great and now we can peacefully let go the classical character.",True,0.4233301877975464,0.3834456503391266,0.4355093836784363,0.39926475286483765,0.36634892225265503,0.3908333480358124,0.42419958114624023,0.40263831615448,0.3914315402507782

An aged\, Logan now a drunked limo driver lives on the Mexican Border with an old Prof. Charles Xavier who can no longer control his powers and has a pessimist attitude\,  and Caliban a mutant who can sense any mutant but can stand sunlight\, Logan due to his age\, his healing power has weaken and some of his wounds can't heal at all\, meanwhile a group called The Reaver\, who had hunted down the mutants\, leaded by Donald Pierce a cyborg\, are looking for a girl called Laura\, whom happens to be a clone of Logan\, she has the same healing powers and was given the same Adamantium Implant. LOGAN reluctantly accepts to help the girl along with Charles\, so they start a journey to take Laura to a safe place\, due to she being the last hope to the mutants to begin a new generation. \n\nThe film has many references to the source material respects very well the Wolverine's Mythology\, and is quiet obvious director James Mangold was inspired by Western films\, there was a scene where Charles and Laura were watching a Western\, I loved that scene because it shows how the three characters\, Logan\, Charles and Laura want to change their lives but cannot denie what they truely are\, but to accept themselves. Now Hugh Jackman delivered us the highest point of his carrer and the best interpretation of the Wolverine character\, now we see an aged Logan who has lost everything and hasn't found the peace he is looking for nor love he wants. Hugh played this character one last time majestifully\, he can transmit pain and peace on certain moments that you want ot get into the screen and tell him how much you really care for him. Charles has lost control over his powers\, he suffers of a deep depression and has hallucinations\, and despite he has a pessimist attitude he never gives his fate on Logan up\, being him the only person who truely has loved and cared for Logan for what he is. Dafne Keen's introduction to the franchise is just more than welcome delivering an incredible and terrifying Laura or X-23\, the rage she shows oh dear\, THE RAGE!.\n\nIn the end I think that the film was an epic\, and beautiful ending of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine joruney\, treating themes like inmagration\, or diversity on people being on a crisis nowadays\, the film is so human by working with this themes. \n\nLOGAN is a contemporary MASTERPIECE.

This process is not uncommon to creative souls and it was the case for Hugh Jackman and his stellar run with the Wolverine franchise. He did something truly extraordinary which was to pull out the big guns on his talent & influence to pay gratitude and homage to a role which made him a super-star. In his latest film \""Logan\"" he portrays the character to its core essence and simply hit it out of the park. Inspired by what \""Unforgiven\"" had provided to the western genre\, Jackman's team does it for the superhero genre as his final curtain call for the role in a fashion any artist would envy.\n\nAs a comic book buff since my teenage years for more than a couple of decades ago\, I came to know the character Wolverine very well like millions of fans. But when you grow up with it and you really know it\, you may be forgiven to take a small ownership of it too. How Hugh Jackman was able to embody the character so well was just uncanny. Since his very first scene as Wolverine 17 years ago\, I was impressed- \""wow\, this dude pulled it off just perfectly...\"" as I remember thinking to myself (worth mentioning that I was disappointed with how Cyclops was not even close).

I figured it was just good casting and great acting at the time\, but 17 years on and  9 features later I now have another notion about Jackman and the role. He's become a A-list movie star and could've passed it on after 2-3 reprisals of the role as that's very common-citing creative growth blah blah blah. Jackman is a multi-awarded actor for other genres- he clearly doesn't need Wolverine career-wise. He instead fell in love with it  and committed his entire movie career to it\, and to close the loop like he did in Logan  is simply sublime. So here's what I think now- as a professional he wanted to paint his ultimate stroke with a final curtain he can be happy with\, a masterpiece. \n\nHugh Jackman did so with Logan with excellent writing and directing from James Mansgold-a film that is a motion picture version of the many graphic novels of past. For those unfamiliar with graphic novels- many would describe them as \""alternative world\, grittier\, higher quality writing and artistry\"" than the average comic books. As the term suggests they are novels with social commentary and acute observations of our current misgivings as the human race- excluding a group of people due to fear\, people's struggle to fight oppression and longing to be with family- all relevant right now. Jackman recalls how films like The Unforgiven\, the Wrestler\, Shane being the inspirations for this personal look into the antihero\, Logan. How violence  have marginalized him into a self-contained jail\, the traumatized soldier barely coping with the repercussions. Listening to him talk about the film in interviews validates that he genuinely respects the fans\, loves the characters\, and truly understands the human story of struggles behind it all. If any of that gets too deep it's ok\, just enjoy how familiar characters from Marvel are juxtaposed into a classic western film\, set in a not-so-distant future.\n\nLogan - it's gripping\, real and emotional. So much so that both actors sir Patrick Stewart  and Jackman got choked up in the final scene of the film at the Berlin film festival of its screening. Trust me\, Mr. Stewart has seen and done everything in film and theatre\, it takes a lot to get him to shed a tear. What a classy way to bid farewell to a role after so many years- to bring the best and deepest  portrayal for the end. True craftsman of their art\, for their fans\, and to their characters. Just beautiful. I do however believe there's one more at least we'll see from Hugh Jackman on the Logan mythology\, perhaps 10-20 years from now- a similar path Clint Eastwood had done with \""Unforgiven\"".",True,0.4163559377193451,0.4385741651058197,0.4255620539188385,0.4420608580112457,0.39678657054901123,0.4217933714389801,0.39273765683174133,0.42303112149238586,0.4506116807460785

137141,Logan,2017-03-07,4,"In 2000 a fresh-faced Aussie actor with only a handful of local credits to his name scored the prized role of Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men. 17 years on\, Hugh Jackman delivers his ninth and final performance as the metal-clawed mutant\, and it's arguably his best. Set in the not-too-distant future where mutants are all but extinct\, our eponymous antihero is eking out a living as a limo driver on the U.S-Mexico border\, predominantly to fund his alcohol addiction but also to provide for the mentally declining Professor X (Patrick Stewart). Happy to drink his remaining years away\, Logan's waste of a life is upended when he's forced upon to transport an enigmatic girl\, Laura (Dafne Keen)\, across the country to safety. Shedding the usual superhero template\, this entry into the X-Men universe plays out more like a slow-burn\, gritty Western\, or a violent\, modern-noir road trip flick; you can take your pick. The emphasis on building character and atmosphere through weighty dialogue\, metaphorical plot devices and an unrelentingly sombre tone won't be for everyone's tastes-especially those expecting the normal comic-book fare-but it's undeniably ballsy and mostly poignant. There are long stretches without action\, however when the set pieces come along they're executed with a brutality that is both completely apt and utterly surprising. Wolvie slices and dices his way through hordes of henchmen\, but this time they actually bleed. There's a reluctant grimness to the fighting this time around too; the carnage doled out by Logan is not presented as 'fun' or 'enjoyable' in the they-had-it-coming kind of way\, but rather as a heavy burden that weighs him down. At the core of the proceedings is the two-hander between Jackman and newcomer Keen; the former all weary pessimism driven by regret\, the latter naively filled with optimism and hope despite the odds against them. Anchored by two powerhouse central performances and a smart narrative that dispenses with superhero convention\, Logan is the bleak\, vicious and no-holds-barred farewell this iconic character deserved.",True,0.22031529247760773,0.18120339512825012,0.12823550403118134,0.17807136476039886,0.10718636959791183,0.14732296764850616,0.18450278043746948,0.15976852178573608,0.2960072159767151
137147,Logan,2018-01-31,4,"In 2029\, no mutants have been born in 25 years. Logan's (Hugh Jackman) healing ability has weakened and he has aged; he spends his days drinking and working as a limo driver in El Paso\, Texas. In an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico\, he and mutant tracker Caliban (Stephen Merchant) care for nonagenarian Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)\, Logan's mentor and founder of the X-Men. Charles\, a psychic\, suffers from a brain disease that causes him to have destructive seizures unless controlled with medication; a seizure a year earlier killed seven mutants\, leaving Logan\, Caliban and Xavier as the last of the X-Men. Gabriela Lopez\, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen\, tries to hire Logan to escort her and an 11-year-old girl\, Laura (Dafne Keen)\, to Eden\, a refuge in North Dakota. Logan reluctantly accepts\, but finds Gabriela killed. He is confronted at his hideout by Gabriela's killer Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook)\, Transigen's cyborg chief of security\, who is looking for Laura. Laura has stowed away in Logan's limo\, and has powers like Logan's. She\, Logan\, and Charles escape Pierce and his Reavers\, but Caliban is captured and tortured by Pierce into tracking Laura. A video on Gabriela's cellphone shows that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA samples to turn into weapons. Laura was created from Logan's DNA. As they proved difficult to control and Transigen had found an alternative\, the children were to be killed\, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some of them escape. In Oklahoma City\, Logan discovers that Eden appears in an X-Men comic in Laura's possession and assumes it is fictional. The Reavers arrive\, but Charles has a seizure and incapacitates everyone in the vicinity except for Logan and Laura\, who kill the attackers and inject Charles with his medication. As they flee\, Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant)\, head of Transigen\, arrives to help Pierce...\n\nLogan premiered at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival on February 17\, 2017\, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 3\, 2017\, in IMAX and standard formats. The film was critically acclaimed\, with praise for its performances (particularly those of Jackman\, Stewart\, and Keen)\, screenplay\, direction\, action scenes\, tone\, and themes; critics considered it a departure from traditional superhero movies. The film became one of the best-reviewed films in the X-Men series\, with some critics considering it one of the best superhero films of all time\, was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2017\, and received a nomination for the Best Adapted Screenplay at the 90th Academy Awards\, making it the first live action superhero film to receive a screenplay nomination. A commercial success\, it grossed over $616 million worldwide against its $97 million budget\, making it the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time behind Deadpool\, The Matrix Reloaded and It.\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads\, \""Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as Wolverine with a gritty\, nuanced performance in a violent but surprisingly thoughtful superhero action film that defies genre conventions.\"" Some reviewers noted Logan as one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. Scott Collura of IGN gave Logan a score of 9.7/10\, and called the film\, \""an emotional\, heavy picture\, but it's also an uplifting one that reminds us that it's okay to fight for something more\, something better\,\"" and \""perhaps the best X-Men movie yet.\"" A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film an 'A-'\, and said \""[the film] manages to deliver the visceral goods\, all the hardcore Wolverine action its fans could desire\, while still functioning as a surprisingly thoughtful\, even poignant drama-a terrific movie\, no 'comic-book' qualifier required.\"" Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'B-'\, and called it \""both the most violent film in the series and the most sentimental one. When it's not showering you in blood\, it's trying to make you spill tears.\"" Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter reacted positively\, saying: \""Seamlessly melding Marvel mythology with Western mythology\, [director] James Mangold has crafted an affectingly stripped-down standalone feature\, one that draws its strength from Hugh Jackman's nuanced turn as a reluctant\, all but dissipated hero.\"" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it 4/5\, stating \""It is more like a survivalist thriller than a superhero film\, and signals its wintry quality with the title itself\"" and compared Wolverine's hitting of his truck during the film to Basil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers. James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave it 3.5/4 and said\, \""In terms of tone and content\, Logan is Deadpool's polar opposite but both productions refuse to play by traditional superhero movie rules ... With his glimpse into what superhero movies can be\, James Mangold has given us something sadly lacking in recent genre entries: hope.\"" Kyle Smith of the New York Post also gave the film 3.5/4 and said \""the film recognizes that superhero movies such as last year's forgettable X-Men: Apocalypse have become meaningless spectacle ... I'd rank it beside X-Men: Days of Future Past among the best X-Men entries.\"" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com stated\, \""Logan has stakes that feel real\, and fight choreography that's fluid and gorgeous instead of just computer-generated effects. Most importantly\, Logan has characters with which you identify and about whom you care. It's not just 'great for a superhero movie\,' it's a great movie for any genre.\"" Brian Truitt of USA Today said\, \""Easily the best Wolverine outing\, Logan is [the] Dark Knight of the mutant-filled X-franchise\, a gripping film that transcends the comic-book genre by saying something important.\"" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5/4\, and called it \""a hard-ass\, R-rated rager that explodes with action\"". Amy Nicholson of MTV called it \""a phenomenal\, throat-slashing\, gut-stabbing superhero movie\"". Germain Lussier of io9 said\, \""Logan is beautiful\, sophisticated\, and still a kick-ass superhero film\"". Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound called the film \""A game-changing masterpiece.\"" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered said\, \""It's not just one of the best superhero movies ever\, it's a damn-fine cinematic representation of the human condition in all its agonizing forms.\"" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said\, \""It's the best superhero film to come out of the comic-book world\, and I'm not forgetting Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.\"" Jackman's acting as Wolverine has been lauded with wide acclaim and his performance topped The Hollywood Reporter's Greatest Superhero Movie Performances of All Time list. On the other hand\, Anthony Lane of The New Yorker reacted negatively\, saying \""If ever there was a time to hang up [Hugh Jackman]'s claws\, that time is now.\"" Mara Reinstein of Us Weekly gave the film 2.5/4 and specified\, in a lukewarm review\, that \""[T]he film loses its way during the 20-minutes-too-long journey. For all the breathless talk about how Logan transcends the superhero genre\, there's nothing groundbreaking about a road trip movie in which adults try to elude the bad guys to protect a super-special child.\"" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2/4 and said\, \""Logan is deadly serious\, and while its gamer-style killing sprees are meant to be excitingly brutal\, I found them numbing and\, in the climax\, borderline offensive.\"" Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine said\, \""The grim side of human nature is all over James Mangold's Logan. But that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie.\""\n\n\""Logan\"" is a fine piece of ending of Hugh Jackman´s version of Logan/ Wolverine. The story is compelling and great and there´s so many layers of the X-men universe that works perfectly in this film. It´s an emotional\, believable and difficult movie with age\, sickness\, mental problems and dying in the centre and the will to fight for what you believe in. It´s not your ordinary superhero film\, but something much more. Director James Mangold has managed to create a brilliant piece of superhero movie that breathes something different and with that western feeling to it. Yes\, it´s violent\, brutal and bloody\, but everything comes together in a beautiful way in this X-Men film. Dafne Keen is great as Laura Kinney\, Jackman is excellent as the dying and worn Logan (and he goes out with a bang as this is his final portrayal as Logan and maybe his finest hour as Logan as well) and Patrick Stewart gives us a final great performance as Charles Xavier. However\, I didn´t think the Pierce character worked (not intimidating nor visually strong). \""Logan\"" is nevertheless a great one within the superhero universe. \n\nTrivia: - Hugh Jackman admitted to having two lingering regrets about retiring from the role of Logan/Wolverine: that he never appeared in an Avengers movie and that he never appeared in a Deadpool movie. Jackman said that had he known Deadpool (2016) was going to be such an enormous hit\, and that his performance as Wolverine was a recurring gag in the movie\, he might have postponed his retirement.\n\n- In June 2017 Logan became the number 1 superhero movie of all time\, on RottenTomatoes\, knocking The Dark Knight (2008) to number 2.",True,0.1678333878517151,0.19482526183128357,0.16770240664482117,0.1017012894153595,0.07523662596940994,0.11200717091560364,0.11284448951482773,0.08603856712579727,0.14569686353206635

138030,Logan,2017-03-10,4,"In general\, all of the X-Men movies that I've seen have ranged from terrible to good\, so I don't ever anticipate them like I do other Marvel super-hero films. In fact\, I wasn't even sure that I cared to make the trip to the theater for Logan when it was originally announced. However\, some great trailers changed my mind. I went from disinterest to excited quickly\, and all the glowing reviews I read didn't hurt either. The film didn't quite live up to the hype\, but it is one of the better X-Men franchise films. The best thing they did with Logan is work on establishing characters and not spending so much time getting lost in the X-Men mythos. There are a few subtle nods to the past through props and little lines that people deliver in the midst of other conversations\, but no one ever takes time to explore everything that happened in the past. This is probably a good thing because the past of the X-Men films is quite confusing and full of paradoxes.\n\nWhat sold a lot of people on Logan is the fact that Wolverine was finally getting an R-rated film. It makes sense for a character who has knives on his hands to actually be shown cutting people which leads to blood. My concern was that they would just overuse the R-rating. Simply because they CAN include more violence\, language\, and sexuality doesn't mean they SHOULD. In the first part of this film they did exactly that. They overloaded with awkward and out of place F-bombs\, and even made a point of getting some boobs in there. Later on they showed restraint and stuck to language and violence that was warranted by the plot instead of shoehorning it in like a middle-school kid who just learned a new curse word.\n\nThe violence is worth talking about in Logan. It is gory at times\, but effective. I thought there were several moments that it helped me feel the brutality of a fight\, and also feel the pain that a character is suffering. I could have done with a lot less of it being handled through CGI\, though. While the computer graphic artists have become quite good at making convincing effects\, there are still moments where it looked artificial\, and I hate when I can detect their work. A lot of this is hidden behind quick cuts and fast-moving cameras\, so it was rarely something blatant that lasted long on the screen.\n\nThe story in this movie is all focused on the 3 lead characters\, but particularly Logan himself. Hugh Jackman delivers a strong performance and sells himself as the old man who doesn't have much gas left in the tank. Without spoiling anything\, I'll just say that his performance is so convincing that it took a particular event for me to realize that he was acting and Hugh Jackman isn't really that old. Patrick Stewart is absolutely remarkable as an ancient Professor X\, when the script isn't awkwardly shoving curse words into this mouth. He is a great guide and conscience in the film and plays a vital role along the way. The newcomer\, Dafne Keen\, is the third main character in the film. I think for a young actress she did quite well\, and I connected with her a lot more than I expected. The villains were a bit underdeveloped\, but I think they were simply meant as obstacles for our heroes. Besides\, I kind of like villains who are evil simply because they love being evil\, so I don't need a ton of time spent on their motivations.\n\nLogan is what some might call \""deliberately paced\"" and what others would simply call \""slow.\"" They take their time working on motivations\, relationships\, and all that deeper stuff that your average superhero blockbuster would avoid. I appreciated all of that\, but even among all the good stuff there was probably some areas where they could have trimmed it down to help with the pacing. Logan also takes advantage of a fair amount of metaphor (perhaps a bit too much) which you could argue takes it a step above the mindless films we usually get from the big studios. While there were a few aspects that I struggled with\, I can't deny that the film was effective. It was deeply emotional\, and there were a couple of scenes that were handled so perfectly I have to applaud the film-makers. Logan is worth a watch if you are looking for something a little different from the classic character.",True,0.7084648013114929,0.6811937689781189,0.6786637902259827,0.6873658299446106,0.6863712668418884,0.7093385457992554,0.6781907677650452,0.7324180603027344,0.6725088953971863

143540,Logan,2017-03-04,5,"It's taken me awhile to write this up for a couple of reasons. There's is something about this film\, something that lingers\, like an itch you can't scratch long after you watch it. There's something there that niggles me\, bugging me still\, even after my second viewing. In my opinion\, it's not an X-Men movie\, yes\, official it is\, but it's nothing like any of the previous films\, it's like Mangold has done away with the typical superhero formula and filled it with drama and emotion making a connection to the characters better than ever before. The other reason is wanting to write a review that gives the film justice without giving away any spoilers. It's a film you want to talk about once you've seen it but so hard to other than to say \""it's good\, you should go see it\"" to people who haven't seen it yet. But\, here goes. \n\nFinally\, the tenth instalment of the X-Men franchise\, the final part of the Wolverine trilogy and the last time we'll be seeing Hugh Jackman as the X-Man\, holding the record of playing the same superhero more times than anyone else\, that record being 10 times if you include the cameos. Jackman wanted to end it on a high before becoming a \""oh\, it's you again\"" character and James Mangold does Wolverine ultimately proud. Possibly learning from critics\, previous films and his own mistakes in Wolverine\, a film he didn't write or screenplay. We know he can make a good film\, examples being Walk The Line\, Girl\, Interrupted  and my personal favourite of his is his remake western\, 3:10 to Yuma. \n\nNow\, I'm no expert\, but this film isn't strictly based on any one comic but Mangold appears to have written an amalgamation of a few comic storylines influenced by Old Man Logan entwined with some of the latter part of The Uncanny X-Men series including X-23 with certain questionable  references to Mutant Massacre. It's allowed Mangold to superbly weave together a workable story however\, starts off with some very obviously plot-fillers which does make the film very predictable but not in the slightest any less enjoyable. \n\nIt's 2029 and there's no one left of the mutant population\, apparently wiped out apart from Logan\, Charles Xavier and Caliban\, being nothing more than relics of a world gone by\, forced into hiding to live out their remaining days. But someone comes along\, a young girl by the name of Laura who has some remarkable abilities that resemble someone we're all too familiar with. Hunted by the cybernetic Reavers\, lead by Boyd Holbrook's Donald Pierce\, a rather confident\, bold villain that has the same cockiness and attitude of Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone\, the remaining mutants are forced to flee and embark on a road trip chase across the states to find safe haven. \n\nMangold does a great job of focusing on the heroes' vulnerabilities\, knuckling down and stripping them of their strengths. he takes advantage of their weaknesses and exploits them bringing a sense of humility and pity towards the characters. Xavier suffering from a form of dementia whilst Logan is getting old and becoming weak from the adamantium that's slowly poisoning him. \n\nLaura\, superbly played by relatively new comer Dafne Keen\, making this her big screen debut does a captivating piece of work as the mute\, killing machine. She gets a crash course in life\, learning quickly about right from wrong and what it is to care and grieve. Emotions she has never been allowed to afford being raised as a feral engineered weapon. There's some subtle scenes which displays her emotional development\, especially during the end when compared to her fellow subjects proving that her path has taught her more about life than what the others have experienced\, watching her transition is mesmerising. I love how they use the classic western Shane to parallel the film and to prove what some of us forget\, the reason why some of us love films that teach us those crucial lessons of right from wrong and the areas in between\, including honour\, courage and hope. \n\nJackman plays down Logan brilliantly\, still wanting to be that lone wolf\, selfishly reluctant to help anyone else\, even a nine year old mutant that reflects very much of himself. But he cannot help his intrigue or deny his paternal instinct when he recognises her abilities. There's also that misunderstood fear people gain when witnessing what Logan is capable of\, showing his tormented soul and his yearning for peace. He's clearly had enough and accepts whatever fate comes to him. I want to discuss this more but can't without spoiling the film. \n\nThe supporting cast is good\, Richard E. Grant as the soulless corporate head\, Dr. Rice who's trying to capture and eradicate his mistakes. Interesting choice of Stephen Merchant to play albino\, mutant tracker\, Caliban who unfortunately lacks weirdness for me. Patrick Stewart is brilliant\, showing a humorous yet entirely different side of Professor X\, but Eriq La Salle!!? Thought I recognised the name in the credits only to then recognise the face from Coming to America! \n\nThere's some really strong elements here\, superbly shot and put together. The impressive  action is ferocious and brutal\, but doesn't go completely over the bar. It's gone for the R rating but not because of the success of Deadpool as some have assumed\, it had always been intended to be an R rated film\, however it does seem to compete with Deadpool in terms of cursing\, with even Charles Xavier throwing more than a few \""f\"" bombs. It's Marvel without the filter\, which is both funny in parts and welcome. \n\nWhat nags me\, and not in a bad way\, is the similarities it shares with others movies and none of which are from previous Marvel or superhero films. There's just more to it. I got a hint of Terminator 2\, Man On Fire\, Léon\, even Solomon Kane and A Perfect World. I think that's what works for me here\, it takes all the feeling out of those films and crams it into Logan till bursting. However\, slight downside is the ending reminding me a bit of Hook! See if you can see why. \n\nThe production is superb overall\, not being set to far into the future\, there's only a few mild changes that could easily get overlooked like the video billboards and the uber style dashboard. Mangold's regular composer does a soft and often thrilling score with minimalistic piano notes that helps give the film that somber tone. I'm keen to see Mangold's black and white version of the film\, like George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. \n\nIt's a Marvel movie for the mature Marvel/superhero fan being right up there with being the most emotional\, raw superhero movie which actually\, and I thought I would never say this\, but aside of Deadpool\, make me appreciate the X-Men movies a little more\, especially the character of Logan. You might find yourself totally forgetting about the rest of the X-Men. \n\nCan't say it's ended on a high\, but that isn't a criticism\, it's ended perfect\, giving Logan the final farewell he so deserves which ends on a sad low\, with many viewers leaving with a tear in their eye. It's so much more than a X-Men movie\, it's more than just a superhero movie. It's a perfect ending for Logan\, a bold and heartbreaking farewell. \n\nRunning Time: 10\nThe Cast: 8\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 9\nStory: 10\nScript: 8\nCreativity: 9\nSoundtrack: 8\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for breaking the terrible mold the previous X-Men Movies had and giving us something entirely different\, something more. \n\n91 % 9/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",True,0.9318608045578003,0.9129160642623901,0.9272043108940125,0.918764054775238,0.8910473585128784,0.9271469712257385,0.9298388957977295,0.9327355027198792,0.9368177652359009

139724,Logan,2016-12-12,4,"I seem to be \""that guy\"" that\, in almost every instance\, isn't as impressed with comic book/superhero movies than the general public. It makes me feel like a pretentious tool a lot of times; why can't I just enjoy stuff? Then\, every once in a long while\, movies like Logan come around and prove that the synthesis of high-octane action and storytelling with a sense of depth is entirely possible and does exist. This is a movie that has a ton of moments between its characters that are tender and sad in equal measure\, a majority of times without being blatant. Not quite all of it sticks the landing one hundred percent\, but it's all very admirable in content and artistry and makes for a worthy swan song to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. It's 2029 and the mutants are on the verge of extinction. Logan (Jackman) works as an Uber-type driver and drinks and pops pills in his spare time when he isn't crossing the border into Mexico in order to take care of Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)\, who lives with Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in a run-down farmhouse. One day a bio-technician for Alkali-Transigen named Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) requests that her young\, silent mutant daughter Laura (Dafne Keen) be escorted to a place in North Dakota dubbed \""Eden\"" while in pursuit by those trying to hunt down the remaining mutants. This film is much of a western in terms of both the simplicity of the story and Jackman's grizzled lead\, but the inspirations of the genre extend past that and past the locales and into utilizing similar tones and themes. There's even a scene in which Logan\, Laura\, and Xavier watch Shane together. Director James Mangold\, who co-wrote the script with Scott Frank and Michael Green\, makes the tone of the movie the most important aspect\, and I appreciate the hell out of that. The script combined with his direction allows for scenes of silence--of reflection and longing--to speak more than the dialogue does. The quiet moments are arguably the loudest and most human\, and the movie also knows when to inject just enough humor to maintain the dynamic between the characters in more than just one way. One can't go without mentioning how\, thanks to the success of Deadpool\, this movie is rated R. The action is brutal with slashing\, stabbing\, blood-letting\, and at least one decapitation\, but it isn't gratuitous. The movie's content is motivated and since the movie is slower than most other movies within the genre\, the R rating feels like it gives more of an impression of realism\, often in the form of cussing in addition to realistic injury detail. There is one scene of brief nudity from some random woman that felt unnecessary and cynical\, though\, as if the filmmakers or studio executives were ticking a box in terms of the content that they were allowed to include. I said in the opening that the movie doesn't work completely at all times\, but it is consistently admirable in its approach to the character and wrapping up his arc. The movie seemed to be a bit underwhelming towards the third act in what it does with the character of Laura\, and the finale wasn't as lengthy as I would have hoped. Again\, it's consistent in how it follows the rest of the movie both narratively and tonally\, and it does end on a strong note. However\, some aspects felt a little quick to me. There's also the issue of the movie taking place in 2029 but every single piece of technology being exactly as it is nowadays\, ranging from phones to chargers to TVs to remotes to cars to... everything. In a few locations it felt warranted\, but it was distracting every time someone pulled out a device and accidentally dated a movie that just came out. Overall\, Logan is a great movie and\, speaking a person that doesn't have a vested interest in the character or the X-Men mythology as a whole\, I was thoroughly engaged. The directions that Mangold and company decided to take the movie make it feel more mature than comparable fare\, with pathos and a sense of finality in a majority of scenes. It's one of those blockbusters that's entertaining and has a notable amount of artistry\, and although this comparison has been wrung out to death over the past nine years\, comparisons to The Dark Knight are generally earned. 8.5/10\, great\, B+\, definitely above average\, etc.",True,0.5765624046325684,0.5925586223602295,0.5707478523254395,0.5871768593788147,0.4774419665336609,0.5492058396339417,0.6334599852561951,0.5702458620071411,0.6201632618904114

140758,Logan,2017-03-05,2,"I think they should have never launched the Wolverine series at all and written off Logan even before\, but better late than never! The film had such a promising potential\, specifically in how to explore Prof Charles Xavier Alzheimer's disease\, ageing and still unrelenting\, formidable mind. Patrick Stewart gave such a beautiful performance\, that redeemed the entire film\, set off against Hugh Jackman emotionally and physically constipated performance. It is astonishing that after ten films in the series\, Jackman's character still acts like an angry teenager. Well\, it seems like all white men are either behaving badly or sadly as Jack Halberstam said. The film's dystopic setting\, where the future is nothing more than giant corporations taking over every aspect of our lives\, doesn't feel very futuristic\, but rather very much of the present. Even the notion of developing hybrid species in the bellies of poor Mexican women does not sound too futuristic. Hence the use of young children as soldiers (and as the precursors for future series of X-Men)\, the most disturbing part of the film yet\, the role of Laura\, Logan's alleged child and little assassin. Not sure how they managed to film that\, but I don't think I have seen that much violence involving a child before. Harrowing and disgusting really. Apparently in the future\, evil is cartoonish\, one-dimensional and mercenary (surprise surprise!).  There's so much to be frustrated at in the film\, Charles Xavier's inglorious death\, Logan's pettiness and self-pity\, how most of the characters lack any depth at all.

140840,Logan,2019-01-01,5,"I think we need to talk about the X-Men\, most specifically Wolverine for a bit.  When I was a young child\, I loved the X-Men.  In fact\, my three favorite superheroes had to have been Spider-Man\, Batman and\, of course\, you might have guessed\, Wolverine.  I think Venom and Beast were a notch below that to close out my top five as a kid.  I dressed up as Batman AND as Wolverine as a child.  I don't remember dressing up as a Spider-Man\, but I may have worn a mask or two.  I don't think my fandom of these three heroes shaped my childhood as much as The Simpsons did\, which I also grew up loving\, but I do have very fond memories of my time spent with these heroes and their stories.  Fast-forward to 2000 and the original X-Men movie comes out which\, as far as I can remember\, is the first Marvel movie to\, you know\, be any good.  There was a 1989 Punisher with Dolph Lundgren that\, apparently\, was not very good (depending who you ask).  A year a later the first Captain America movie came out and it was somehow even worse than the Punisher.  At the time DC was killing it with Burton's first Batman film\, so Marvel was playing catch-up in terms of quality.  So\, really\, at the time X-Men came out\, it was kind of the saving grace for Marvel.  It allowed them to successfully transition most\, if not all (early-to-mid 2000s Daredevil\, Elektra come to mind immediately\, of their heroes to commercially and critically successful movies.  I'm not saying that without X-Men's success that the MCU would not have existed\, but it certainly made it more viable than it was prior to X-Men's release.  2003 saw the release of X2\, which was\, at the time\, one of the best superhero movies ever made.  The end for the original X-Men film trilogy\, obviously\, came with The Last Stand\, which wasn't that good.  The franchise\, after The Last Stand\, needed rebooting and\, in 2009\, came the first Wolverine movie.  I remember really hating this movie with a passion.  Like I loathed it\, I remember being really fucking pissed off at how much of a joke Gambit was made out to be\, particularly considering the potential that character had to be really fucking cool.  Moving on from that flick\, we got X-Men: First Class in 2011 and Days of Future past in 2014\, which were both great.  On the Wolverine front however\, in terms of standalone films\, we got The Wolverine in 2013.  This brings us to 2017's Logan\, the film that brings us together and the film that serves as Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman's final acts as Professor Charles Xavier and Logan/Wolverine\, respectively.  A lot has been said about this movie\, with some even regarding it as one of the finest superhero movies ever made.  A movie that defies the typical conventions associated with the genre to create something meaningful\, with strong characters you care about and surprising emotional depth.  And with that\, I must say that this movie is quite unlike every superhero movie I've ever seen.  It's not about Thanos killing all life on earth with this Infinity Stones.  It's not about the Joker causing chaos in Gotham.  It's not about Doctor Octopus causing havoc in New York and Spider-Man protecting its good citizens from a madman.  This movie is about one man saving his soul by helping Laura\, a girl created from is DNA by this biotechnology company intent on\, of course\, creating soldiers from scratch\, cross the border into Canada to\, hopefully\, find a safe haven there.  It's about Logan's slow deterioration.  He still heals\, but it's not nearly as effective as it used to be anymore and he's in constant pain\, so he's turned to alcohol as a painkiller.  His abilities are nowhere near as good as they used to be either.  One of the many things that I like about this movie is the fact that Logan carries the weight of everything that has happened to him.  Not just in terms of all the battles he's fought\, the wars he's been in.  I mean the loss of his friends\, as him\, Xavier and Caliban\, officially\, are the last X-Men alive.  The movie takes place in 2029\, 25 years after the birth of the last mutant.  The same biotechnology company that is creating these mutant children from scratch are also the ones\, whose experiments\, responsible for\, essentially\, exterminating the mutants\, as it were.  As far as Charles Xavier is concerned\, however\, much like Logan\, his health has deteriorated to the point that he is not the same.  You see\, Xavier suffers from a form of dementia that\, without medication\, causes some severe seizures that leaves anyone in the vicinity suffering from temporary paralysis.  If it goes on long enough\, people could actually die.  With that said\, there was an incident prior to the film's events where Xavier suffered one of these seizures that injured hundreds and killed seven of the other X-Men.  None are ever named and this incident is only talked about in the movie\, it is never shown.  And that's what I love about this world\, the actions of the past have relevance to what we are seeing now\, as it should be.  The reason I mention that is because it adds to the feeling that this world existed prior to us joining Logan for his last journey.  Xavier's last incident forces Logan to hide Xavier in Mexico and having Caliban look after him in this abandoned smelting plant.  Logan and Xavier have suffered the consequences of their actions and you can see it in the body language they display and their attitude towards each other.  Logan and Xavier have a more antagonistic relationship than they ever have in the past\, but that's as a result of the past and I do think the movie does a great job of that.  In spite of them not showing you anything of what happened to Logan and Xavier in the time since we last saw them\, you know that they've been struggling.  Emotionally and physically.  This opens the door to explore some different angles to tell a story within the context of a superhero movie.  To say that this movie is more like a noir western than it is a superhero movie is kind of an understatement.  To the point that the Blu-Ray DVD (that I own) includes a disc where there's a black and white version of the movie.  And the film wears its western influences on its sleeves\, quite openly.  But it uses those influences to craft a new story\, something unprecedented in the superhero world.  The characters\, more than any other film in this genre that I've seen\, drive the narrative forward.  It's not the action\, it's not the special effects.  It's the actors and their performances that carry the movie forward.  This is a fantastic movie  by any standard\, it's not JUST a great superhero movie.  And that's something that a lot of the films in the MCU fail to achieve.  They're great superhero movies\, period.  And I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that\, it's just that that means that a lot of these movies end up playing it safe in terms of its approach they take to the visual and narrative aspects of their films.  That's a major problem the MCU has faced throughout their ten years of existence.  Visually and thematically\, the MCU have got this homogenized look and feel and\, never\, has anyone sort of ventured from that.  I love Black Panther and it is\, quite possibly\, the best film in the MCU yet (and one of the best of last year thanks to its thoughtful narrative)\, but it still fits within that mold that Marvel has created.  It doesn't really attempt to explore new avenues to tell a story that are not associated with the genre.  There's no real attempts to\, truly\, transcend the genre like\, really\, only one film has done.  That film is\, obviously\, The Dark Knight.  This movie is the other.  And\, if I'm being honest\, I find that this movie even goes farther than The Dark Knight ever did in terms of pushing the genre past its normal boundaries.  It still very much feels like a superhero movie pushed to its extreme\, in a good way.  But Logan manages to avoid those pitfalls and\, essentially\, tell sort of a survivalist/road trip/western/noir film\, where the characters at its core as the most important tenet to carry its narrative forward.  Even The Dark Knight still revolves around the Joker threatening to destroy Gotham and causing untold amounts of destruction\, injuring thousands of nameless and\, mostly\, faceless people.  This movie is about two men\, Logan and Charles\, helping this girl reach a safe haven for mutants\, all children like her\, across Canada.  And\, of course\, they're also on the run from Alkali Transigen\, the company that created Laura from Logan's DNA.  There's no threat to the universe\, the threat is to Laura and the rest of the mutant children that Alkali was hoping to turn into soldiers\, the threat is to Logan's sou; as\, again\, he's been broken  by everything that he's gone through.  I love that stripped down approach.  It tells personal story\, more so than any superhero film ever made.  Black Panther is the only thing that comes close.  I love Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Logan\, he is tremendous here.  He is a man who\, and this is a trait Wolverine has had throughout the franchise\, of now knowing who he is.  He\, even at this point in his life\, hasn't found who he is as a result of how he was created and what he was created for.  I think that's a theme that carries heavily throughout the film and something that Logan tells Laura at the end of the film\, that she shouldn't be what they made him to be.  I do think that Logan struggles with that daily and\, again\, it's one of the many things in his life that has led him to the point he is in this film\, a broken-down\, bitter and angry Wolverine.  Same thing with Patrick Stewart\, who captures the fragility of a 90-year-old Xavier perfectly with his performance.  Dafne Keen\, as X-23 or Laura\, is a great addition to the franchise and her performance as this character doesn't feel forced\, because she has the perfect angry face to pull off\, quite literally\, a mini-Wolverine.  She's kind of a badass and some of the best action scenes in the entire film are X-23's.  But\, at the same time\, the movie doesn't forget that she's still an eleven-year-old girl (I wonder if this was a Stranger Things nod) and they do try to showcase that in some of her later interactions with Logan.  I suppose we need to talk about the action now and\, quite frankly\, it is tremendous and brutal.  That's the best way to describe it\, but in its own context of course\, it feels believable\, there's nothing cartoonish about it.  Its level of violence might be off-putting to some\, but I think it helps the world feel more real\, feel more threatening.  In short\, it should be obvious\, that I fucking loved this movie.  If there is a flaw\, and there is one\, is that I do think the pacing could have used some tightening up.  Other than that\, however\, this is still a tremendous movie.  Easily one of the best movies in the genre and\, really\, only the second one that manages to transcend the genre's limitations to become something more\, something different and unique that has never been seen before in this genre.  Is it the best superhero movie I've ever seen?  Honestly\, I don't know.  I'll have to watch The Dark Knight again in order to properly decide\, but this is an easy recommendation.  Phenomenal movie and a fantastic send-off to a character that we've known and loved for almost 20 years.\n\nAs a bit of an side\, I imagine this is like a postscript\, I have to talk about 20th Century Fox's merger with Disney and what that means for Deadpool and the X-Men film franchise.  Look\, I've enjoyed most movies in the MCU\, but they all do kinda look and feel the same\, which I mentioned in this review.  And I'm worried that that's what they're gonna do with Deadpool and the X-Men.  20th Century Fox's handling of these franchises\, X-Men most specifically\, has not been perfect.  But I also have to give credit where credit is due\, Simon Kinberg and his team have been the only ones to truly take risks on behalf of Marvel.  If Disney owned the rights to the Deadpool character from the start\, we wouldn't get those two great movies that we got.  We would get something resembling that\, but far more family-friendly.  Family-friendly is fine\, but there needs to be something edgier and Deadpool offers that in spades.  Logan would be absolutely nerfed and censored by Disney in order for it to ensure a PG-13 rating\, completely draining it of its essence.  And that's what I'm worried is gonna happen now that these characters\, seem\, to be reverting back to Marvel.  What does that mean for Deadpool?  Disney does have Buena Vista and they COULD release the sequels under that banner and still keep it R-rated.  But I don't think Disney is gonna wanna do that\, I think they're gonna wanna strip Deadpool of his personality and have him fit into the mold that they've created and perfected.  I'm not saying it wouldn't be cool to see Deadpool interact with some of the members of the MCU\, but if that means completely destroying the character's essence\, then I don't care for that.  There's enough characters in the X-Men universe for him to interact with.  As far as what that means for taking risks\, I do not know.  Deadpool has already been established as a foul-mouthed and violent mercenary.  It's kind of difficult to go back on that if Disney fully takes over.  But with a movie like The New Mutants\, which hasn't been released yet\, and serves as the thirteenth installment of the X-Men franchise\, I wonder they don't fuck with that movie.  It's a HORROR movie in the superhero genre\, I mean that's something fresh and I would wish that Disney would take wild risks like this with its characters\, but they don't.  Because that's not a guaranteed over half-a-billion worldwide gross.  Disney does what is going to earn them the most money and horror isn't gonna make them the most money when compared to\, yet\, another homogenized entry in the MCU.  I don't think any self-respecting fan of the genre wants that.  Again\, I've enjoyed MANY films in the MCU\, but they're all very similar thematically and tonally.  I just hope that this doesn't mean the end of risk-taking for superhero genre as a whole.  I mean we have the DCEU and I guess there's hope in them using their standalone movies to try some new ideas\, but it's something that we're gonna have to wait and see.  Oh\, and before I end this\, I forgot to give props to James Mangold's excellent script and direction.

141473,Logan,2017-03-22,5,"It is a known fact that 20th Century Fox's X-Men franchise has revolved\, wisely or not\, around Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.  We forget and take it for granted that Jackman gave his own unique take on the character\, made him simultaneously an action hero and a sex symbol\, and left his mark on Wolverine that will both live on in the comics and in the movies featuring the Uncanny X-Men.  It's unfortunate that X-Men Origins: Wolverine was the dumpster fire that it was\, but at least The Wolverine was a solid movie\, before it fell apart in the third act.  But Logan is a different monster altogether and it comes out of left field with no direct connection to the previous X-Men movies (which was probably a wise decision).  Director James Mangold takes what did work on his previous entry The Wolverine\, and throws out the shlock which brought it and so many X-Men movies down\, resulting in a lean and mean yarn about violent men on the edge of civilization.  It's a weighty R-rated drama that LOOSELY adapts the Old Man Logan alternate universe series by Mark Millar.  Logan\, is essentially\, a Cormac McCarthy post-modern Western with themes of loneliness\, family\, sacrifice\, and yes - mortality.  The human condition\, wrapped up in a bloody\, violent\, depressing\, and introspective nutshell.      \n\nJackman gives a bravura performance as deep and meaningful as his work in Prisoners or other more acclaimed dramas and his transformation into a bitter\, alcoholic\, and forlorn man with no future is something to behold.  I suspect this man will win an Oscar eventually\, and if he doesn't then it matters not - he is the genuine article and this film proves it.  Patrick Stewart is an international treasure for the ages and it must not be ignored that he too has left an indelible mark on Charles Xavier.  A good chunk of the film revolves around the conversations between these two and Charles' need to teach Logan one more lesson.  Stewart clearly has much fondness for the character and watching his mind slip into dementia is a hard thing to watch\, but he provides the heart of the movie and its most meaningful subtext in regards to the movie's message.  And yes\, newcomer Dafne Keen provides great entertainment and a promise of a new future heroine as X-23\, a new female Wolverine who is still just a child on the run from evil government agents who wish to use her as a (you guessed it) super soldier.  The plot and villains are fairly stereotypical\, but they are merely the backdrop to a deep and engrossing character study that just happens to feature mutants and superpowers occasionally.  \n\nThe soundtrack\, direction\, cinematography\, and violent encounters are near flawless and the sparse western American locations suggest an apocalypse has happened.  And in the case of our mutant characters\, it kind of has.  Many have compared Logan to the acclaimed video game The Last of Us\, and I suppose visually and somewhat thematically this is true to a point.  But\, I believe it has more in common with the late John Wayne era classic The Cowboys\, in particular the third act.  (Look it up.)  This is a must see\, and I cannot emphasize it enough\, even for people who care little about the X-Men or the genre in general.  It has the emotional punch and gravitas that most award-winning dramas strive for and fail utterly in achieving.  Logan is the end of one story and the beginning of another.

149115,Logan,2017-02-20,5,"Ladies and gentlemen\, after over 17 years\, the era of the Wolverine has come to an end. \""Logan\,\"" the latest film in the \""X-Men\"" franchise has been released\, meaning that Hugh Jackman will no longer be playing the character that made him a household name. Does it feel like a fitting conclusion? Well\, before we go into that\, let's discuss a few things.\n\n            Ever since the dawn of the millennium\, Hugh Jackman has been the man unleashing the blades of the clawed Canadian\, and not one actor has dared to even offered to carry on the torch for him. Even in brief cameos in the new timeline trilogy and \""Deadpool\,\"" he's always been there. Of course\, with Wolverine's popularity at a high\, mostly because of Jackman\, surely he'd receive his own solo film. That is something that happened\, but instead\, he got his own trilogy.\n\n            The first of the \""Wolverine Trilogy\"" is \""X-Men Origins: Wolverine\,\"" released in 2009\, directed by Gavin Hood. And looking back on it...it's not that good. Granted\, I didn't think the film was AWEFUL and unbearable to sit through. I thought it had some fun moments here and there\, and I do think one of the best aspects of it was the inclusion of Liev Schrieber as Sabertooth. His chemistry with Jackman\, including the element of making the two brothers\, was a great contrast that adds to the rivalry...just kind of wish the rest of the film was as good as that. Everything else is crap\, crap\, and mega crap.\n\n            The second installment\, \""The Wolverine\"" directed by James Mangold\, took to adapting the Wolverine in Japan story from the comics\, which discusses Logan contemplating his immortality\, and trying to protect the granddaughter of an important ally of his from WWII. Not only was the action better\, but everything else was brought up to a much higher level than the last film. The action\, the narrative\, the performances\, it almost feels like the Wolverine movie that we wanted. Sure\, there were some hiccups in the story\, especially near the end\, as it still being toned to PG-13\, despite being filmed for an R rating\, but it was a step in the right direction.\n\n            When the announcement of a third Wolverine movie was coming out\, and after \""Deadpool\"" showed us R rated Marvel movies can still be successful as hell\, it was confirmed that this third movie would be R rated. Meaning\, it was going to be dark\, violent\, and really ballsy...however\, what we weren't expecting was Hugh Jackman to say this would be his final performance as Wolverine.\n\n            So\, is \""Logan\"" the swan song that Hugh Jackman wanted it to be for fans? Well\, I'm not going to lie...not only is \""Logan\"" good\, it's a film where the more I think about it\, the more I love it.\n\n            In the year 2029\, mutants are essentially an endangered minority\, as Logan is one of the few left in the world. However\, because of the adamantium\, his body has become poisoned and his healing factor is getting slower and slower\, making him less capable of fighting back. Soon enough\, a little girl named Laura comes into his life\, being hunted by officials that want her weaponized. Now Logan and a sick and dying Charles Xavier must get Laura across the Canadian border\, before this game of cat and mouse gets them all killed.\n\n            Not only does \""Logan\"" work as a superhero film\, it works as an incredible western and family road drama. You have this journey of these three people travelling across the country\, mostly desert and open ground\, trying to escape government officials that are up to no good\, and you see the chemistry between the three of them build up and pay off in one of the most emotional experiences I've ever seen on screen. With the kind of praise that critics have been giving it\, I now completely understand why they would suggest this as an early Best Picture contender. James Mangold not only proves his absolute excellence as an action director\, but in terms of drama\, he handles it better than we gave credit for.\n\n            And may I say\, this is easily the best acted of not just the \""X-Men\"" series\, but one of the best acted films I've seen from ANY action movie. Hugh Jackman delivers his best performance as Logan\, and I'd dare say it's worthy of an Oscar nomination. You see the emotions that he's struggling with\, both from his time of seeing so much hell on this earth happen and seeing people he loved taken from him\, time and time again. That emotional baggage catches up to him\, and with his body starting to fall apart\, it's even more emphasized. Even in moments when he has to set his claws loose\, it takes a drastic toll on him\, and you fear that this moment could be his last. It's the most human that you feel out of the character in so long. Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier also gives a performance that had me close to tears several times. When you first see him in this movie\, you feel so helpless that he's reduced to such a horrible condition\, and how it's lead him to do things that completely break his spirit. He takes it upon himself that he's hurt people worse than anyone could ever imagine\, and that he doesn't deserve the generosity that Logan continues to give him since\, despite him being the only true sense of connection he has left with the other X-Men. He really does have the most heart breaking scenes in the movie\, and whenever he and Jackman work off of each other\, it truly emphasizes the father-son relationship that they've had since day one.\n\n            However\, the true scene stealer is from Laura aka X-23. For those who don't know\, X-23 was a character that was originally created for the cartoon \""X-Men Evolution\,\"" but instead of being a teenager\, they make her into a child. I honestly thought it was good decision to go with\, and Dafne Keen\, in her film debut\, is absolutely incredible. She's mostly silent in the film\, allowing her physical actions to carry the performance\, and she does it magnificently. It reminded me a lot of the acting levels of Tom Hardy and Ryan Gosling\, someone who can carry a performance with very few words\, but deliver the same or more emotion as if she did have them. Much like how Jackman and Stewart share a great father-son connection\, Keen adds that element of a daughter to the mix better than I was expecting. You truly feel that heavy mix of frustration and concern with all three of them\, and not once does it ever feel dull.\n\n            The more I thought about the film\, the more I thought of one complaint\, which is more of a nitpick\, honestly. I didn't really like who Wolverine fights in the end\, because it feels like a cheap cop-out. I was kind of hoping that the climax would feature Liev Schrieber as Sabertooth\, allowing the whole Wolverine/Sabertooth storyline to finally come full circle and conclude...but we didn't really get that. But that's just a nitpick.\n\n            Yeah\, I have to say\, the more I thought about\, the more I truly love \""Logan\"" as one of my favorite comic book movies. With its action\, characters\, storyline\, and the heavy emotion that was brought to all of that\, I feel like it's a film that is going to mark a major change for the superhero genre. \""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\,\"" you have some new heavy competition.",True,0.38658803701400757,0.384577214717865,0.364388108253479,0.36148205399513245,0.3531293570995331,0.36236894130706787,0.3479210138320923,0.3884223699569702,0.348245769739151

Im not sure what the future holds for Marvel/DC in terms of whether or not they continue to make the movies R rated or keep them PG rated. But right now between Deadpool and Logan everything else fails in comparison. Part of it is the not holding back on the violence and part of it is the well thought out story lines they use (thus far).\n\nWhile both Deadpool and Logan are 10/10's for me they both have far different approaches to their stories. Whereas Deadpool relies heavily on the comedic side of the hero's character Logan has taken a more serious approach ala BvS and then expanded on it with flawless execution. While I try not to pick on BvS much anymore I think they had the right idea and approach but got lost with the direction which ultimately hurt that film. This would also apply to Suicide Squad which I think would of benefitted greatly with a more serious approach.\n\nWord was Suicide Squad was supposed to be a little more like Watchmen which would of done great wonders for that film but again\, DC fucked it up.\n\nSo lets get to the plot of Logan here.\n\nThe story of Logan surrounds itself with the idea that mutants are becoming more and more rare because of a corporation that has managed over the years to track them and kill them off. Our story obviously has one of the few survivors in Wolverine as well as Caliban and an aging and broken down Charles Xavier (Professor X). Wolverine himself is in no better shape as the metal in his body seems to have been poisoning his body of the years and now is starting to take its toll.\n\nTo further compound the problems Logan is still disgruntled and non-caring about most things in the world although he works as a limo driver to get money so that he can buy illegal prescriptions for Charles Xavier who a few years earlier lost control of his telekinesis and ended up killing a lot of citizens accidentally. The medication that Logan gets helps control the spells that Charles suffers from (sort of like epilepsy). As Logan works he is eventually tracked down by a woman who formally worked at the company which we discover has been manufacturing mutants for military purposes.\nThe woman tells Logan that she stole one of the kid mutants who was born in the facility and that her DNA was used from him making the young girl his daughter by blood. Unlike Logan who was born initially with bone blades and then later had the adamantine added to his body the young girl was created with the metal body casing. Obviously the girl is being tracked by soldiers who are trying to retrieve her and some other children who escaped at the same time. While there is plenty of action in this film it is the more serious dialogue and interaction of the characters that make Logan so great.\n\nWhen watching the interaction of Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)\, Logan (Hugh Jackman)\, and the young girl Laura (Dafne Keen) you really feel the pain\, hurt\, sadness\, and emotion the actors bring forth in the film. Its probably the first time I was brought almost to tears at the end of a comic movie because of the fantastic performances. I can go back in the X-men catalog of movies and remember that I liked a few of them but after watching this they all seem to be so hollow in the end. As i said before i dont know what the companies will do going forward but im having a very hard time feeling they will be able to top this and Deadpool. Get out and see this shit NOW. \n\nMy Rating: 10/10",True,0.3292115032672882,0.2892459034919739,0.28726959228515625,0.29847922921180725,0.30687597393989563,0.3222832977771759,0.27620628476142883,0.31088218092918396,0.3145049214363098

Now Jackman brings out the claws one last time in Logan\, the third installment of the X-Men Origins: Wolverine series. It's the year 2029 & the mutant civilization has been shrinking dramatically thanks to a virus created by the Transigen Project. We find a sick & aging Logan whose powers of self-healing are disintegrating. He has become caretaker for an ailing Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who he has stashed safely (more or less) at his hideout in Mexico. While slugging it out\, earning money as a limo driver to fund a better life for Charles\, fellow caregiver Caliban (Stephen Marchant)\, & himself\, Logan is approached by former Transigen nurse Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez) who offers him $50\,000 to get her & Laura (Dafne Keen)\, a mysterious young girl who has many of the same qualities as Logan (including behavior & attitude\,) across the border into Canada. Laura & Gabriella are being hunted by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook)\, Transigen head of security\, who leads a group know as the Reavers\, all intent on getting Laura back in the custody of to the Transigen facility. When they attack Logan at his hideout\, he is forced on a desperate road trip with Charles & Laura in the attempt to elude Transigen & make it to the Canadian border. But can a failing Logan get Laura to safety before his time is up? The Wolverine's James Mangold returns as director\, also co-writing the screenplay with Scott Frank & Michael Green for this intensely entertaining & profoundly moving movie which is not without a mixing of wicked humor. The performances from the cast were very well done. The R rating is essential to capture the honest interactions of Logan & Charles.

150215,Logan,2017-03-03,5,"\""Logan: A Life Lived Well\""\nDeath is as much a certainty when it comes to life as is love. Both symbolise regeneration and rebirth albeit of two very different kinds. When the X-Men film series commenced with 'X-Men' in the year 2000\, and let's stick to the movie X-Men here for the sake of simplicity\, it had Sir Patrick Stewart's Professor Charles Xavier posing a simple question to young mutants. He asked if mutants were the next link in the evolutionary chain or simply a new species of humanity fighting for their share of the world.\nThat question\, 17 years later\, forms the basis for 'Logan'. The story of a battered\, worn-out and defeated Wolverine and a doddering curmudgeon of an old man in the form of Professor X\, the movie is a rich character drama as far away from modern superhero cinema as is imaginable. It's the year 2029 and mutants are all but extinct. Logan\, older than ever with a significant decline in his healing abilities bides his time driving a limousine on the US-Mexico border and caring for Professor X\, who is now in his 90s and long declared a 'Weapon of Mass Destruction' by USA because of his terrifying telepathic seizures. They\, along with another mutant called Caliban live in an abandoned factory on the border. Logan wants to gather enough money to get to safety on high sea. However\, the wrench in his plans comes in the form of a little girl who turns out to be a mutant and is being hunted by shadowy forces. For the sake of keeping things non-spoilery\, let's just say that this is where 'Logan' turns the tables on modern cinematic superhero genre.\nWolverine is a brutal character in the comics. He slices and dices through human flesh and more with considerable bloodshed to spare. In the movies however\, the berserker has been kept under control because of the large audience (read: kids) it can cater to on a friendlier and less bloody scale. 'Logan' doesn't have to abide by this rule as it is an R-rated fare\, which means only people above the age of 18 years can enter a theatre showcasing it.\nThis provides the movie with the ability to unleash a caged beast like no other iteration has been able to do. He may be old\, but he is still a beast.\n'Logan' plays like a road-trip movie through the desolate wastelands and pompous grandeurs that await us in the future\, sharply keeping its focus on the three central characters but it is their respective journeys inward that elevate it to cinematic glory. It is a stupendous showcase for the incredible actors that are Sir Stewart\, Jackman and the young Dafne Keen\, who mesmerizes in her turn as Laura. Jackman\, whose swan song the movie is\, leaves one speechless with his haunting turn as the titular Logan. The character's weariness and sadness that engulfs him now can only be measured by Jackman's astute handling of the same. Credit to writer-director James Mangold for not falling prey to clichés and easy outs\, especially considering that it is Jackman's final turn wielding the claws. He instead chooses to look at an ageing superhero through a sympathetic eye and digs for humanity in his characters and their relationships.\nThe supporting cast is rounded out by Boyd Halbrook (Narcos)\, Richard E. Grant and Stephen Merchant\, who plays Caliban. Only Halbrook and Merchant are able to do justice to their roles.\nWith a watertight screenplay\, that keeps its focus on the characters rather than their antics or abilities\, and three of the best cinematic performances this year\, 'Logan' easily becomes the best superhero movie to have ever graced the screen\, easily upending 'The Dark Knight'. But more importantly\, it also becomes the best movie this year has offered yet. If this doesn't fetch nominations in acting\, writing\, possibly directing and other technical categories at next year's Academy Awards\, then the Academy can\, well\, sod off.",True,0.047838203608989716,0.05073777586221695,0.056430522352457047,0.04796738177537918,0.044721800833940506,0.04352835938334465,0.04440872743725777,0.04970413073897362,0.04406050220131874

150219,Logan,2017-03-03,4,"Logan\, another standalone film residing in the ongoing X-Men franchise\, is the 3rd and final entry for popular character: Wolverine\, and promises to end the character off on a more darker\, violent\, and very tightly focused final film that send-offs Hugh Jackman and starts to borrow from some of the more violent comics based on his character (and as much as most don't like to admit it\, bring a shit ton of fan-service of seeing Wolverine just decapitate people in R-rated fashion). And after hearing a lot of rave reviews from critics and mainstream audiences and fans\, I finally got to check out this film and see how it lived up. And how where my overall thoughts on it? Well...the answer is gonna shock you. And trust me when I say this because it certainly surprised me by the time the end credits rolled. But Logan overall was...really good. Not\, however\, amazing or even great as a lot are praising it as. Which\, REALLY surprised me to be perfectly honest. While by no means an awful film nor a boring or mediocre one at it's core\, I would have to say judging this film on it's own two feet it has some problems that bog down my score in what is otherwise a pretty overall great conclusion for this character and pretty much a great film overall. The negatives\, such as issues with the films fast pace\, often times quickly cut and choppy editing\, disappointing villains (say for one who's a spoiler)\, and even tonal shifts that make some scenes hard to interpret as either funny or serious\, do sadly hold my rating on the film. And if that would of given some more time into fixing\, my rating for this film would of easily been a solid 8 or 8.5 out of ten. Because what we then have\, is not only a well structured standalone \""comic book\"" film that makes use of it's setting and timeline to do it's own tale and of all things be reminiscent of old westerns\, but is emotionally charged and dark in a new and fresh way despite comic book films like Fant4stic copying this tone. Thanks to: Almost legendary performances from Hugh Jackman (who no surprise\, really made his last performance from being Wolverine to Logan stand out and memorable while keeping the essence of his character)\, Patrick Stewart and especially Dafne Keen\, a predictable but still well structured story that manages to pull some surprises up it's sleeve\, beautiful cinematography and color scheme that adds to the grittiness of the world\, a very well balanced script that SERIOUSLY knows how to use witty banter and memorized dialouge to fit well with the tone of the film\, X-23 (Laura) being the most fun and adorable  character to watch with her childlike quirks and quiet presence\, Rated R action that while a bit too into the close up range is gritty and used very BRUTALLY but still effectively and bittersweet\, nice small reincorporation in scenes that connect later into the film\, A LOT of emotional but sweet moments with our main characters\, and overall delivers on a engaging but dark as hell tone. Logan overall I can say is one of my definitive favorite Wolverine films seen yet and much like the film's goal was\, really sent a well made send off to Hugh Jackman and the character he REALLY did put a lot of dedication into. And while I'll definitely be in the minority for not enjoying it as much as others did\, It is honestly worth the watch. But just has some big hiccups that lower my score.\n\nScore: 7.5 / 10",True,0.9524469971656799,0.9460942149162292,0.9457271695137024,0.954471230506897,0.930258572101593,0.9565019607543945,0.9313116669654846,0.955736517906189,0.9438666105270386
150220,Logan,2017-03-19,4,"Logan: A Swan Song\n\nBeast. Hero. Samurai. Cowboy. Hugh Jackman is all of these. He also plays Wolverine/Logan/James Howlett. In fact heâ??s been doing so for the last 17 years\, and after 9 movies he told the world he thinks heâ??s done it enough. In the custom of auctions: he saved the best for last. With a peerless cast\, a gritty new rating\, and a fresh spin on the superhero genre\, Logan proves to be the crown piece of the X-Men franchise. However\, donâ??t let that fool you into thinking youâ??re in for the flawless masterpiece its reputation is suggesting. Hurt by easily avoidable faux pas and gaffs\, Logan falls just short of its full potential.\n\nLogan takes place twelve years in the future. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is much older\, more haggard\, and his body doesnâ??t work like it used to. Heâ??s tired of the grind\, and heâ??s tired of fighting the trouble that always seems to find him. Just when he thinks he can finally retire with his old mentor Professor Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart)\, a little girl (Daphne Keene) walks into his life. The girl has the familiar issue of being chased by a para-military scientific organization\, and an even more familiar mutation. Logan is coerced into putting his retirement plans on hold to try to get this girl to safety.\n\nIf the story seems a little familiar to you\, itâ??s because that was on purpose. Logan was set to parallel the classic Western film Shane. I wish I could tell you that I figured this out from an in-depth analysis in the analogies of the film and the subtle nuances in style and meaning\, but I canâ??t. Logan tells you thatâ??s what itâ??s doing. Forming parallelisms to classics is a commendable tactic in film\, especially when the film is a fresh take on the original (for example\, this being about a former superhero as opposed to a gunslinger). What is reprehensible\, however\, is being so blatant about it that Logan literally played a minute of clips of Shane in the movie\, and later a character directly quoted from those clips. Parallelisms should be realized by audiences\, not told to audiences\, depriving them of the pleasure of drawing their own conclusions.\n\nSpeaking of deprived pleasures\, the new R-rating on Logan made us all realize what weâ??ve been missing for the last 17 years: a ton of brutal violence. While violence does not necessarily make a movie better\, when your main character has kitchen knives growing out of his hands and rage issues\, it does. Watching the gory dismemberings and stabbings in Logan\, the audience finally sees the piece of the character that had been missing for all that time. We didnâ??t realize how much better it would make his movies until we finally saw it\, and it felt right. Rating this movie R was one of the best executive decisions made in superhero film history. Not only does it help the character in the fight-scenes\, but it helps the character in his dialogue too. Dropping F-bombs all over the movie sounded so natural coming from the disgruntled\, angry man that the audience forgets this is the first time heâ??s used it more than once a film.\n\nLogan wasnâ??t the only one to revel in the newly approved language. None other than the mild-mannered Charles Xavier traded R-rated barbs with Logan throughout the movie. This reinforced their new relationship dynamic as two very very old friends who have been spending a lot of time together. The chemistry between the two actors was so powerful that you have to conclude that Jackman and Stewart spent everyday after shooting at the bar together. While their performances were even better than their normal â??outstandingâ?? level\, one would be remiss to not mention the real surprise of the film: young Ms. Daphne Keene. A bilingual young actress with a penchant for choreography who can play an audienceâ??s emotions like Yo Yo Ma plays a cello\, Â one day weâ??ll be recalling when she had to be listed as â??Introducing Daphne Keeneâ?? because she has talent enough to hold her own with veterans Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart.\n\nThis amazing acting did have a drawback\, however. Watching the movie you can appreciate the character growth and development both individually and for the relationships between the three main characters. However\, if you were reading the script\, and not caught up in the powerful acting\, you would realize that none of this actually took place\, and that it was merely an illusion cast by the actors. The characters-arcs went next to nowhere (more of a character-straight-line) because the film both wanted to express their stubbornness to change\, and their ability to change. They split the difference and had them represent neither of these facets\, leaning on the actors to pull through (which\, admittedly\, they do).\n\nWhile this (and a very sloppy plot-device midway through) unfortunately detracts from the flow of the film\, the audience does still have reason to put this movie above your average action-heavy superhero flick. Making this a Western-themed movie does amazing things when looking at the symbolism scattered throughout\, and the overall meaning of Loganâ??s journey. Like a good movie should\, the audience is left thinking about not just Loganâ??s purpose in this film\, but his whole life. These sorts of morality debates always leave an echo effect in the minds of the audience\, causing films like this being much more memorable. So while flaws are present\, they are well overshadowed by the raw talent\, energy\, excitement\, and impact this film has on the audience.

150227,Logan,2017-03-06,4,"Logan:  B\nFirst of all\, I really enjoyed this movie and desperately wanted to give it an A\, but... there were a few glaring hiccups I just can't get past.  With all the winding Wolverine roads the X-Men series has taken\, there definitely needed to be closure and this was an impressive attempt.  The film is less of a superhero movie than it is a race to the boarder- spaghetti western. Huge Jackman nailed his aging role and played well off of his declining health from The Wolverine. Dafne Keen was brilliant and brought to light a child character full of diverse emotion and qualities.   \nOk\, so my biggest pet-peeve here was Mangold's need to follow cinematic trend\, and by way of Deadpool. People love gore\, bad-ass heroes and unpredictable acts of random humor... but there was no need to ramp up Logan's foul language\, just because people like Deadpool.  Sure\, Mangold will defend his R rating with violence\, but there was no need for an F-bomb every few minutes.  I get it\, Logan is old\, curmudgeoned\, medicated\, and lost his sensor... but it cheapened things for me.  I'm not going to complain about a set of boobies either\, but common... did that clip really accentuate his aging?  Why skirt the sentiment with cheap innuendo\, just show the impotent Wolverine killing prostitutes out of rage...oh\, does that cross the line?\nThe whole time I was watching a suspenseful action movie while occasionally fed something that was forced by \""what people like to see these days\"". If you are going to make a true R rated movie about a conflicted and volatile dark character...then go there\, don't tease me with candy from van. Even the children\, designed to be trained assassins\, were barely lethal when it came down to it.  I was also very disappointed in the send-off of Charles.  His powers were so great\, even in the near realm of Jean Gray\, that he could have traversed the dimensions at bit\, maybe even pulled off Obiwan-like interventions from the beyond?

150262,Logan,2017-03-09,4,"Logan feels like a movie that knows what it wants to achieve and where it wants to take the audience.\n \nThe storytelling is refreshing and concise\, everything that happens on the screen is necessary to build all of the characters overall arcs. Logan starts in a very isolated and broken place and never grow too far beyond that point\, during the films time frame. Mangold has penned a film where less is more\, story elements are never fully explained and he treats the audience with dignity\, allowing them to piece together the movie and not feel like he has to hold your hand during its 137 minute run time.\nOften hints and whispers are laid out for the audience to follow and it a masterful seeing it all unravel.\n \nToward the later parts of movie the films length can be felt and you may start suffering from numb bum. Overall it flows at a natural pace and feels really well crafted.\n \nHugh Jackman's performance as the titular character is his best to date\, truly given the opportunity to finally stretch his acting chops in the role. He snarls\, groans and growls in a role that could only be performed by Jackman. He IS Wolverine/James Howlett/Logan. If this truly is his final performance in the role\, then he will be greatly missed and I feel for the person that must fill those Canadian boots.\n \nSimilarly\, this is an entirely different Portrayal of Professor X. Weak\, vulnerable and now listed as a Weapon of Mass Destruction. Stewarts' handle over the role with its vulnerability and frailty is in perfect merged with the authority that has been ever present since established the character over the 17 years.\n \nOther characters are well cast and feel well suited in the perspective roles\, Dafne Keen as Laura is another stand out performance\, but this is Logan and Xavier's picture to run.\n \nThe R rating (15) isn't just a certificate\, its permission/ a release for Logan as a character\, no longer are shots obscured and camera angles used simply imply the carnage that Wolverine is capable of. It is all laid out in front of the audience and you see the animal that was released from Alkali Lake during the original X-men movie. It tastefully done too and never out stays it's welcome. Several sequences are very much a franchise high for the character.\n \nIn essence this is an A-Z film that achieve so much more than just reciting the letters in the middle.

150263,Logan,2017-03-07,5,"Logan feels very Mad Max in its opening\, in that there is very little one cannot glean from the visual storytelling of director James Mangold.  In fact\, the entire movie could conceivably be cut into a silent film that would still make perfect sense at the end of the day.\nWhat truly sets the film apart from the rest of the X-Men universe\, however\, is its handling of the concept of hope.  There is no magical macguffin fix for the problems these character face.  In fact\, there are some problems they can never fully solve - just deal with.  But nevertheless\, they persist.\nLogan (Hugh Jackman) feels like a world-weary cowboy in a modern era; the film draws quite heavily from the Western genre.  Logan's struggle is not one against evil so much as it is against time.  This is not to say the film feels frantic\, however - time is more an obstacle simply because of its weight.  Logan has lived for hundreds and hundreds of years\, and it shows.  He feels worn out.  Frayed.\nEven in his moments of Wolverine rage\, he no longer feels like a furious animal - he feels like an animal lashing out after being back into a corner.\nOne could argue that Wolverine may be so muscular because he has so much emotion baggage to lug around all day.\nThe wear and tear on Wolverine are shown in splendid visual storytelling throughout the film; Logan can drink and actually get drunk\, he takes longer to get up after being shot\, he bandages his wounds instead of shrugging them off\, and his claws scrape against his bones when they come out.  Unfortunately\, the fact this this is still a blockbuster film menas there is a scene of necessary exposition\, but even this is bearable given the talent behind those delivering the lines.\nMerchant is tremendous as the broken down Caliban\, Stewart is indistinguishable from the character of Charles Xavier\, and Dafne Keen starts her career in tremendous fashion as the angry-but-hopeful Laura.\nIn order to avoid spoilers\, I will not describe the actual plot of the film.  Rather\, I will simply say that Mangold's handling of hope in a broken world is equal parts realist and optimist.\nThis is not a film about forgetting the past.  Rather\, Logan is a film about learning from it.\nThough a few emotional scenes feel rushed\, the film plays out in a way that justifies this incredibly well.  Again\, time is not on the heroes' side in this film.\nWith poetic dialogue that echoes the best of the Western genre\, visual storytelling that makes the film one of the easiest X-Men films to follow (especially considering time travel\, fourth wall breaking\, and Egyptian mythology are all now part of the canon)\, violent and satisfying action that never quite glorifies the acts depicted\, and a more than stellar cast\, Logan manages to simultaneously make us nostalgic for the heroes of our childhood and bring us to the realization that that's not the way the world works.  And once it has done so\, Logan provides us with a modern\, realist interpretation of what it means to be a hero.",True,0.8205917477607727,0.8243039846420288,0.7759478688240051,0.8387764692306519,0.7227936387062073,0.8192910552024841,0.7730313539505005,0.8517700433731079,0.8418740630149841

150265,Logan,2018-01-14,5,"Logan follows an aging Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). In an X-Men universe taking place in the near future where there are very few mutants left. Logan himself sees his powers beginning to wane as he finally appears to age. Logan looks after an aging Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) staying out of the public eye. But\, when a young mutant\, Laura (Dafne Keen)\, is thrust into Logan's life he must decide whether he will stay out or play hero one last time.\n \nLogan obviously is different from what we've come to expect from a superhero film with its rated R tag. And the film doesn't waste any time letting us know we're in for a violent ride. The movie opens with a very bloody fight scene. However\, for me\, I felt the extra violence and gore helped with the overall aesthetic of the story instead of detracting from it. This is a battered and beaten wolverine\, violence is very much part of his life. And even when he tries to escape\, it seems to follow him. This is a very strong theme in the movie and the intense violence helps portray how all the fighting and violence is breaking Logan down.\n \nThis realistic and violent look at Wolverine is a bold idea. Of course with the success of Deadpool this film isn't as much of a financial risk as it may have seemed years ago. Thankfully\, James Mangold was brought on to direct Logan. And with themes of dwelling on the past and past regrets that seem to hearken back to Mangold's more successful works like 3:10 To Yuma\, and Walk the Line. It isn't surprising he does such a good job getting those feelings across here.\n \nMangold does have a lot to work with here. The cast all fits beautifully in there roles. Granted\, no one here is going to win an Oscar or anything. But these characters are completely fleshed out and believable. I believe them\, and more importantly\, I care what happens to them.\n \nThis movie hits all the notes we would expect of a superhero flick. There is a clear line between good and evil. There are some great action sequences speckled throughout. And the dialogue beautifully connects the film to the rest of the cinematic universe\, without it seeming heavy handed or distracting. There are many references to previous X-Men films that were worked in without making the story arch pause to allow them to happen.\n \nSo we've established that this movie is a great installment in the superhero franchise. However\, there were a few aspects of this movie that helped it stand far above an ordinary superhero movie.\n \nFirst\, the relationship between Professor Xavier and Logan works so well. The past is something that is brought up a lot throughout this movie. And Logan and Xavier have been through so much together. And now\, it is just the two of them. This is displayed beautifully throughout the film. Of course\, for fans of the series\, this closeness is incredibly sweet and heartbreaking. Throughout the series Xavier was the only one who believed in Logan. And would let Logan come back every time he faltered. They hint at this in the film with their banter. And Xavier does give Logan a hard time. But it is clear that Xavier cares deeply for Logan.\n \nAlso\, this is a very aware superhero movie. And all of this violence and gore could have easily been mishandled and become a repetitive and pointless part of the film. But there are points all through the film where Logan expresses his emotional\, and now physical\, pain from living such a violent life. This very human look at a superhero's is something that has always proven to be incredibly difficult to pull off. But\, when done right\, has the potential to make a very engaging and entertaining film for lifelong fans and for less avid fans. And this film very successfully intertwines that human element in a superhero universe.",True,0.9834268093109131,0.9830461740493774,0.9840835928916931,0.9854673147201538,0.9818048477172852,0.9849482178688049,0.9855610132217407,0.9826828241348267,0.9833517670631409
150267,Logan,2017-03-07,3,"Logan gets a lot right about superhero movies. It makes its central conflict small-ish in scale\, rather than putting the fate of the world in jeopardy\, but still establishes very real stakes. It eschews a parade of cameos in favour of focusing on two or three characters. It knows that\, while it may be based on comic books\, it is a movie\, and wears its cinematic influences proudly. It uses an R-rating to make its themes and motifs more mature rather than cruder. And it trusts its audience to be smart enough to be able to fill in a fair number of blanks. With all of this together\, it comes close to joining The Dark Knight in the lonely class of great superhero movies that can be talked about without the \""superhero\"" clarification. But while its aims at being a neo-Western and a meditation on purpose are admirable and far from wholly unsuccessful\, Logan is undone in a similar way to its protagonist. Just as Logan the character cannot escape that he is The Wolverine and the violence that entails\, Logan the film cannot entirely escape that it is an X-Men movie and the silliness that comes with the territory.\n\nJust to get the complaints out of the way\, the villains really let Logan down at the end of the day. Oddly\, the villain that shows up early\, Boyd Holbrook's cyborg mercenary Donald Price\, is not the problem at all. Holbrook chews scenery but in a way that adds nicely to the slightly post-apocalyptic vibe the movie has going (more in the category of the original Mad Max rather than Road Warrior or Fury Road\, but the influence is there)\, and normal mercenaries for brief moments feel like valid threats\, as Logan's healing ability has slowed thanks to age and adamantium poisoning. But the true big bad turns out to be an uninteresting evil scientist\, feeding a conspiracy-theory big-government angle that worked well in previous films but falls flat here. I suppose that government persecution works when the metaphor relates to persecuted communities as it does with Xavier's School for Gifted Children\, but seems more extraneous here. The reveal of the real physical threat late in the film is both silly enough to ruin the grounded tone the film worked to maintain\, and thematically rather blunt. Additionally\, while it's thematically necessary that Logan allows blood to be spilled\, it has plenty of scenes of children engaging in gory violence played not for laughs or horror\, but rather excitement\, which doesn't quite gel.\n\nBut there's a lot for fans and non-fans to like here. Jackman has made clear that this is his last time wearing the claws\, and he also visibly wears the struggles of the character over the past eight appearances. Charles Xavier is also provided a new angle for the first time in ages\, as a degenerative brain disease takes root in what is noted as \""the most powerful brain in the world\"". No other returning characters appear\, allowing for a fantastic degree of focus. The collection-of-oddballs road trip consisting of Logan\, Xavier\, and mysterious fugitive Laura powers the films occasionally fantastic middle third\, especially a brief respite of normalcy that serves as a poignant character beat until that silliness shows back up. Logan has the bones (or adamantium skeleton) of a bona fide classic\, but while it serves as a fantastic sendoff to potentially both the cinematic Wolverine and Xavier\, it doesn't transcend its origins in the way it blatantly wants to.",True,0.5469767451286316,0.5259807705879211,0.5888255834579468,0.5336450338363647,0.5029941201210022,0.5267696976661682,0.5382736921310425,0.5382668972015381,0.49473974108695984

So\, he has been trough a lot of pain for losing his loved ones. For him witnessing this sort of tragedies is not new. Try to understand his character\, if he tears up at least a little bit\, it's equivalent to a normal human crying out of misery and heavy pain.\n2. This movie is not made to please audiences\, means it never compromises its approach in delivering the product so that people can have a good time. \n3. This movie is gritty\, depressing\, humorous and true to its core.\n4. Patrick Stewart (Professor X)\, Hugh Jackman (Logan \""The Wolverine\"") and Dafne Keen (X-23) gave \""THE\"" performances of a lifetime\, couldn't reach anywhere better than this peak of acting. Even the characters Caliban and Donald Pierce have a great Structure and approach.\n5. Here I want to discuss a thing called the genre\, we got many like sci-fi\, rom-com\, comedy\, thriller\, western\, drama etc...Here this movie inherits the genre called \""western\""\, I personally feel that this is the best genre among all. because here when people die they die\, this genre concentrates on the consequences of loss and death\, they do not create an emotion of misery we see in drama films. For example\, let me consider a movie Hell or High Water in that the characters Alberto Parker and Marcus Hamilton shares the screen time almost 3/4th of the movie. Now\, we are totally involved and into these one-one character relation. During the climax char(Alberto parker) dies in a speck very simple and straight forward by a bullet shot(no emotional buildup no background music nothing extra) The relation that's being built up for a long time is ended in a second without any explicit drama.

150291,Logan,2017-12-16,5,"Logan is a 2017 Drama Action Superhero movie written and directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman\, patrick Stewart\, Boyd Holbrook\, Stephen Merchant\, Richard E. Grant and introducing Dafne Keen.\n \nThe film takes place in a dystopian future where mutants and the x-men no longer exist. Logan and Caliban care for Professor X away from civilization in hiding near the Mexican Borders\, until a young mutant\, Laura aka \""X-23\""\, arrives at their doorsteps escaping mercenaries  chasing here. \n \nThe film takes place in the year 2029\, 10 years after the concluding events of X-Men Days of Future Past. The film begins with a much older Logan (Hugh Jackman) as a driver sleeping in his car\, until a group of thugs attempt to steal his  tires. From the very beginning limbs start  to fly-off\, f-bombs are dropped and  slicing of bones and flesh commence. The R-Rating\, considered to be the first for this character\, only adds another layer to the characters as well as action that is purposeful and organic. As Logan returns to his hideout near the Mexican Borders\, it is clearly noticeable that his healing powers aren't what they used to be. \n \nLogan and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) help one another in caring for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart) who suffers from Dementia\, Alzheimers and mental seizures. If you ever wondered what happens when the world's most powerful mutant loses his mind\, wonder no more\, as his brain\, literally\, becomes a weapon of mass destruction.\n \nA young mutant that goes by the name of Laura (Dafne Keen) or \""X-23\"" is handed to Logan in an attempt to smuggle her  across the border. to a head out to try and find 'Eden\,' a place where escaped mutants are going to start over\, which may or may not even exist. Reluctantly\, Logan realizes has to protect this girl from the team of mercenaries chasing them led by  Donald  Pearce (Boyd Holbrook) and Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). From then\, the film changes from a family drama movie to a Wester-style road movie bringing to our minds movies like Shane\, Mad Max: Fury Road\, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Universal Soldier. \n \nThe film is loosely based on the Old Man Logan storyline. However\,  due  to the character rights being split between Fox and Marvel Studios\, a detraction from that story was necessary and even added more character development for Logan. While maintaining the superhero powers of our characters\, the screenplay smartly provides elements of realism and tackles moral issues such as aging\, immigration\, medical experimentation and evolution. \n \nThe success of this film is mostly in the realism and grounding of the characters in portraying their fight against time\, purpose and their own legacies. Jackman plays as a man more than a superhero in one of his career's best performances. Stewart brings a different class to the ailing Professor X  and the introduction of Dafne Keen as the young X-23 is amazing and well-rounded. Although she is silent for most of the time\, her reactions and facial expressions made her highly believable and exceptionally talented.\n \nThe main weaknesses in the film as a whole are: \nThe Villains.  Although \""time\"" may be the biggest villain\, the human villains (aka The Reavers) were more as a trigger for Logan's purpose\, and not as menacing as Apocalypse or interesting as Magneto.\nThe Score. Marco Beltrami takes a different approach; with the exception of the intro's piano piece\, throughout the film the score felt very disconnected from what is on the screen. \nPacing. Towards ending of Act Two\, the film just comes to a bit of a halt. It is intended to provide further development in the Logan/X-23 relationship; however\, it was the first moment the  film felt like it was dragging.\nAfter 17 years of playing Wolverine and Charles Xavier\, respectively\, both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart have announced that this is their last \""hurrah\"" in portraying these characters. The most painful part of the films seeing our favorite characters in such a state of disarray\, loss and helplessness. Despite being dark\, gritty and grim\, the film wraps up the story arc of both characters in a fitting and satisfying end.\n \nOverall\, Logan\, isn't just  a \""good superhero movie\,\""  it's great movie of any genre. It was one of the most anticipated movies and deservedly so.

Since he is growing old\, old age comes with a great burden\, his body has aged greatly\, his claws aren't popping out properly and his healing powers are weakening by the day.\n\nSadly\, Logan is not the only remaining X-Men who holds weakening powers\, Charles Xavier (Stewart) is in his 90s and he's currently living in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico. Logan and along with mutant tracker Caliban (Stephen Merchant) care for Professor Xavier who's suffering from a terrible disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic powers.\n\nOne day\, Logan gets approached by a nurse named Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez) who pleads with him to take her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to a safe-haven in North Dakota but he refuses to do so at first. He reluctantly accepts the job but Logan discovers that Gabriella has been murdered so he takes the girl and goes back to his hide-out. Logan also comes across a team of cybernetically-enhanced enforcers called the Reavers and they are led by the cunning and relentless Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook).\n\nPierce wants to take the girl for scientific purposes but Logan refuses which leads to Pierce and his Reaver enforcers to capture Caliban and Logan\, Laura and Professor X to escape. Logan and Xavier are amazing to see that Laura is not only a mutant but she has the same claws and healing powers Wolverine has. Logan and Xavier also find out through a video on Gabriella's phone that Laura is Logan's daughter and she was part of a completed project called X-24. The project was created by Transigen\, a secret sibling from the Weapon X program and the company is headed by a surgical madman named Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant).\n\nAs they are being pursued by the Weavers and Pierce\, Logan does everything he can to protect Laura and the terminally-ill Professor X at all costs as his powers continue to deteriorate. After a terrific action sequence in the Mexican hide-out\, \""Logan\"" turns into a dramatic and at times funny road picture with the two veteran mutants discussing about life\, family and of course death. Superhero movies are not just about fighting crime or stopping evil or how many things you blow up\, they can also be about the characters and their relationships.\n\nThe themes of getting old and dying are risky to put in a superhero movie but those themes alone are the reason why we need more comic book movies like \""Logan\"". Hugh Jackman is so great here as the aging Wolverine\, he may believe it or not receive some Oscar consideration. Come on people! Don't you think it's finally time for an actor to get an Oscar nomination for playing a superhero? Dafne Keen is excellent in her near-silent role as Laura\, the tough and keen young mutant who may lead her own X-Men spin-off series some time in the near future.\n\nWe've superhero movies go into dark directions before (Batman has been through that area many times before) but \""Logan\"" is the perfect definition of what a dark superhero movie should be because it's like a gritty\, Western tale from the veins of \""Unforgiven\"" and \""3:10 to Yuma (2007)\"" in some fashion\, it has a lot of brutal bloody violence and you will probably be sad and moved by the ending.\n\nThanks to director and co-writer James Mangold who helmed \""3:10 to Yuma\""\, the Johnny Cash biopic \""Walk the Line\"" and the 2013 \""Wolverine\"" movie and his screenwriters Scott Frank (Get Shorty\, Out of Sight\, Minority Report\, The Wolverine) and Michael Green (Green Lantern)\, they have crafted a dire\, bleak and more engrossing \""X-Men\"" story than any of the previous entries.\n\n\""Logan\"" should be taken into consideration as a more adult superhero movie because it pulls no punches with it's R rating and this is not your 12-year-old's \""X-Men\"" movie. Like \""Deadpool\"" which was a completely different superhero film\, \""Logan\"" is for older adults and comic book geeks only\, this movie is not for children for sure. \""Logan\"" should pave the way for other dramatic comic book movies in the future like Bryan Singer's 2000 \""X-Men\"" film did when it paved the way to a long-running superhero franchise and gave Marvel the keys to start their own batch of superhero movies as well as a cinematic universe.\n\n\""Logan\"" makes it's mark as one of the first great films of 2017.",True,0.8638790845870972,0.841592013835907,0.832329273223877,0.8605818748474121,0.8434246778488159,0.862906277179718,0.8335385918617249,0.8661791682243347,0.840914785861969

150340,Logan,2017-03-04,4,"Logan is a harrowing\, grizzly conclusion to Hugh Jackman's storied performance: it was no secret that this movie will be the last for Hugh Jackman. And what a performance from Hugh Jackman! He brought out the human faults of this superhero with an intense passion bordering on fury. The fury manifests itself in violence that was never seen (in a superhero movie) in such a graphic and gory fashion. The commitment to detail is second-to-none and any dyed-in-the-wool action fan will relish the carnage onscreen. Among the bloodletting and primal screaming\, there are moments of tenderness that add a depth to an otherwise two-dimensional hack-'n-slasher. Make no mistake\, this is the best Wolverine movie to date and one that will leave a positive note for the potential of this character's future\, theatrical adaptations. I can't help but wonder why it took this long for an R-rated outlook on this source material to be greenlit: I sincerely feel that an unadulterated approach really brings the best (and worst) out of this character. Make no mistake\, this is NOT a child-friendly movie in any shape or form (if you haven't seen the red band trailer by now). \n\nThis movie began in a grim setting and will continue its grim narrative in a rather heavy handed\, if not brutal\, manner until the credits roll. After the credits though\, one wondered: was the running time justified? At 135 minutes\, this was no short feature and I felt that too much time was wasted on scenes and circumstances that were not meaningful to the narrative. If anything\, this whole feature can be written off as an ode to Jackman's tenure as Wolverine. The impression was that Jackman took to the center stage and everything else was sidelined as being \""secondary\""; only after the credits\, do you feel that this approach was a mistake. The central theme of this movie revolved around death and rebirth (the theme of rebirth will be rather insidious instead of outright explicit). Spoilers aside\, not enough time was invested in developing characters outside of Jackman's personal bubble. This resulted in stymied relationships which ironically\, was addressed by a rather effective quip (to Wolverine) from Steven Merchant's Caliban: \""You don't talk to me.\"" Indeed\, the screenwriters (director James Mangold\, Scott Frank\, and Michael Green) chose to distance Wolverine and the audience from what could amount to heartfelt relationships. Without a meaningful connection\, the \""death\"" element of this feature carried little impact: you simply did not witness enough of a character to feel anything meaningful. Sympathy was the first\, real casualty of this movie. \n\nI was convinced that each character (through hints in the brief dialog) had a troubled past worthy of more screen time. Further character development would add more layers to the titular character as he would learn to navigate around the broken environment. The writers literally waited until the last minute before showcasing a surprising change in an otherwise stubborn and resolute personality of Wolverine. The timing was off and this uneven pacing felt more like an exercise in contrivance rather than in character development. Notable actor has to be given to Patrick Stewart in an amazing\, albeit done in brief bursts\, performance as Charles Xavier. He performed in a masterful manner that truly warranted more screen time. Dafne Keen as Laura performed well for a role that flip-flopped between mute and screaming until the last act: then\, she was just screaming. An appropriate pairing\, considering the amount of scripted screaming onscreen; sadly\, the spotlight was scripted to shine on only one in the pair. What you are then left with is an apathetic\, visceral showcase of Hugh Jackman as he rages\, rages against the dying of light.\n\n3.5/5",True,0.38103389739990234,0.36598387360572815,0.35322585701942444,0.36687809228897095,0.3557518720626831,0.3514381945133209,0.33676713705062866,0.3771771490573883,0.3704124391078949

150359,Logan,2019-06-04,5,"Logan is a movie that will leave you speechless\, from the moment it begins to the moment it ends\, every aspect of the film is like a punch in the face (in the best way possible). The emotion\, the tone\, the aesthetic\, the dialogue\, the sentiment\, the music\, it all culminated in the best movie of all time.\n	The film constantly keeps an almost \""run down\"" tone. Everyone is tired\, everything is gloomy\, and the only setting we see is the desert and a rainy cemetery. We are shown exactly what Logan is feeling\, in everything that surrounds him. The only time the setting changes is when the characters are at the farm\, and the end in the forest. Logan is shown to us in everything around him\, and everything he does. Every decision made by the filmmakers makes sense in the best way. \n	Every character in the movie feels real and completely realistic. Logan is run down\, but not a complete asshole. He still cares deeply for Charles\, and later Laura\, and is shown to be protective of the family he has found. Laura feels like a real 10 year old. She doesn't trust everyone completely\, but she cares for them and forms real relationships with them. Laura's way of convincing Logan to take her to North Dakota is just repeating the names of her friends endlessly until he relents\, what genius. Charles acts exactly like a grandfather\, from being the one to insist to take help and get supplies\, to reminiscing with Laura about old movies. The characters act like they always have\, Logan is still gruff and mean\, Charles is still a bit of a know it all\, but they also adjust to their new environments and circumstances\, and they are clearly shown to take on character traits accustomed to a father and grandfather\, without ruining all the character they already had. Plus\, the way Logan wears his dollar store glasses on the bridge of his nose with the tag still on as he watches a phone held a foot away from his face is so perfect\, the moment that scene was shown its like\, \""Yeah. That's a dad.\"" \n	The ending itself is the most emotionally exhausting thing I've ever witnessed. The entire third act is a marathon\, not a sprint. From the part at the farm house\, the end of the credits\, I felt like I didn't breathe. The emotion is spectacularly built\, from the music to the acting to the way everything is shot. The very choice of a final villain is genius in itself. The very idea that Logan is fighting himself is obviously metaphor in itself\, but one that works just way to well. But by far the best part of the third act is the performances. Never once did I question what a character was feeling\, it was obvious in not only their choices\, but simply their facial expressions. The scene where Logan runs back into  the house to find the clone has injured Charles and taken Laura\, and he stands at the base of the steps trying to choose who to help first is INCREDIBLE. It is so easy to understand the conflict that every single character is facing. When the actual ending comes\, I must say\, i did sob. Not only I sob though\, I was struck completely still for the entirety of the credits\, quietly sobbing and barely breathing. For 24 hours after the credits ended\, I was brought to tears at the very thought of the film\, and couldn't bare to watch anything else. Anytime I tried watching anything else\, I was struck by just the emotion of the film's end\, and found myself incapable of absorbing anything else. It has been over a month\, and I still can't listen to \""The Man Comes Around\"" without breaking down into tears. The pure power that movie's ending alone has are amazing. In superhero movies\, it is often hard to completely feel as if a character is truly dead\, but Logan defies that. Teh very thought that Fox or Disney may bring Logan back makes me fill with rage. Logan's ending was the perfect ending\, and nothing will ever top it.\n	One of the best parts of Logan is the way it completely mocks every other superhero movie ever. There's blood everywhere\, everyone's cursing\, dead bodies cover every inch of the ground\, and no one seems completely happy after a fight. The first fight we see Logan get into doesn't show him willingly filling up with bullets\, but acting almost exhausted every time a bullet enters him. Not to say he's completely bothered\, in fact he only fights back when a bullet hits his rental car\, which in itself is so perfect. Several scenes like this stand out\, the scene where they try to run a fence down with their car but it instead just bends inward for instance is so perfect. The decision to make this movie R is one I am forever grateful for. The very idea of making a movie like this PG makes me want to laugh. The blood\, the cursing\, the violence\, it's all so perfect.\n	Overall Logan is a movie that takes everything that was set up for it and says \""screw that\"". It is almost separated from its franchise\, its rating cuts out like half of its optimal audience\, and introduces a new main character that no one knows and is a ten year old girl who never speaks. This movie should have failed\, but instead it became when of the most memorable movies of the decade\, and by far the best the superhero genre has to offer. The superhero movie for every person who hates superhero movies if you will. \n",True,0.7116876840591431,0.673282265663147,0.6153184175491333,0.6857150793075562,0.6148434281349182,0.6981595754623413,0.55344557762146,0.6733266711235046,0.7033188939094543

150419,Logan,2017-01-12,5,"Logan is directed and co-written by James Mangold\, and it stars Hugh Jackman\, Patrick Stewart\, and Dafne Keen in a superhero film about Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) that is done with what he's used to do\, and all he has done lately\, is take care of Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is very sick and dying\, which Wolverine's powers aren't working also. So someone comes to him\, and asks to take Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen) to up north for her safety. Thanks to Deadpool\, we finally got ourselves a rated R Wolverine that I'm sure fans of the comics have been waiting for\, even Hugh Jackman as he wanted to be in it too. Not only was I excited for it being R rated\, but also for the fact that this is the last time that Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine. Even though I never seen the film before\, I decided to buy it on Blu-Ray just so I can own it\, and also because I heard it's one of the best superhero films of all time\, so it was a risky financial move for me\, and it was worth it because Logan is definitely the best superhero films I've seen since The Dark Knight\, and that's my favorite superhero film. I'm serious about this\, but if Hugh Jackman doesn't get nominated for an Oscar\, I will be disappointed because this is probably the best that I've seen him in as you can tell that he's tired\, he's been going at this for a long time\, and even at one point he wants to end it all\, which you clearly understand what he's been going through\, and with him now having to take care of X-23 is a bit much from him. Patrick Stewart is also fantastic in this as while the film itself is dark\, he brings out a lot of humor in it that makes the film even more human\, while sometimes also acting like a very grumpy grandpa which actually seems very relatable for families that have to take care of their parents for the way they act because they care about them very much. The one aspect that surprised me\, was Dafne Keen as X-23. I've never seen a child actor this intimidating\, act very serious that is convincing\, and emotional that's effective that I've seen since either Looper or The Sixth Sense\, which is shocking to see that this is her actual film debut. The action scenes are very intense to watch as this is a story that the director has made up\, with some influences from Old Man Logan and other comic books by Craig Kyle\, and that knowing the fact that almost all of the X-Men are gone\, I don't even know what's going to happen with them\, and not only that\, it's been 17 years since we've seen Wolverine and Professor X in X-Men films\, which we feel like we gotten to know them so well that we hope they survive. The action scenes are very well done that for one of them\, it reminded me of Mad Max: Fury Road for that sense of intensity. The gore effects are great\, and it's enjoyable to watch Wolverine chop heads off with X-23. The writing by Scott Frank\, James Mangold\, and Michael Green is well-written that seems to understand more about what Wolverine was famous for\, while still putting in emotional scenes for the actors to act in\, which are effective enough that for Hugh Jackman's last film as Wolverine\, felt satisfying enough for it to earn those scenes. The score by Marco Beltrami is catchy that makes the action scenes more tense\, but never feeling generic in any sort of way. The cinematography is really nice\, and it doesn't feel like your typical superhero film\, which I love the fact that it goes outside the box when they think of different and new ways to go for a superhero movie. I also thought the chemistry between Wolverine and X-23 is well done that makes sense for those type of characters\, whereas you also find it enjoyable when Xavier talks to her to make her feel better. Boyd Holbrook is actually pretty good as the villain\, but if there's one small issue that I have with the film that doesn't make it better than The Dark Knight\, is that the villain wasn't quite fully developed where you start to hate him and want to see him die\, but there were some development on his character that doesn't make him feel expendable.

I'm going to start off with the acting and a bit of the story so acting-wise Hugh Jackman Nails this character I'm going to go out and say it Hugh Jackman is Wolverine there is no doubt in my mind in my heart that there is never going to be somebody who's going to be as good or even better as Hugh Jackman's betrayal of this character because in this film Logan is old he is tired he's literally working from job to job to help keep Professor Xavier from dying himself or losing his mind which you will find out later in the movie why he's giving him medicine which Patrick Stewart plays Professor X again and he is so so good in this movie whenever Hugh Jackman Patrick Stewart or having some bantering back-and-forth it's funny it's heartwarming it's a father and son relationship these two have established over these past years and it is fantastic seeing these two on screen one more time with each other. as we get further into the film Logan is handed this little girl named Lauren who was betrayed by Dafne Keen turns out to be x-23 from the comics and when I saw her in the trailers I will be honest I was very skeptical because when it comes to children actors they tend to be very unrealistic you can definitely tell that they're acting someone telling them what to do and how to read with her she is incredible from the Stein's to her emotion on her face she is great and I am very happy to say that she will have a very successful career down the line anyway back to the story and once Logan is handed this girl him and her ex and her all on the run from this task force that's after Lauren and I won't go any further into the film without getting into spoilers because I want people to go out and see this picture. this film also does not feel like a comic book movie like how the Dark Night felt like a detective movie this is more of a western movie and it works so well completely in love with this film because director James Mangold also did a film with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale called 3:10 to Yuma which was a remake and I really enjoyed that you can definitely see that he had some of that Western feel to this film and he should be a part of because this is one good-looking movie and the cinematography is fantastic but one of the standouts in this film is how Violet it is it is not over-the-top violent it's more grounded realistic violence why you can see a character like this with these abilities doing this to a person in a film it's very grounded it is very realistic it is very very violent and I loved every second of watching this film it's going to be a very tough year for Marvel even though this is a Marvel property and DC to really top this. one of their other films is better than this film because this movie takes a lot of chances and they all pay off and this film is paced very well even though it runs almost two and a half hours long the pacing is very very good it flows very well time flew by in the theater because I was thoroughly enjoying this picture and a side note I feel like Hugh Jackman could be nominated for this performance because I know how much he gets in this film and I hope he does overall this is my favorite films of the Year already and we're only in March so far 2017 has been a really good year for films from great action films like John Wick chapter 2 to great witty 4th wall breaking humor as the Lego Batman film we are getting some really good film so far this year I am giving Logan an A+ just like the Dark Knight was to be a detective this is at Western and this is a perfect send-off for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character.,True,0.8485013842582703,0.7973126769065857,0.7269901037216187,0.8074641823768616,0.6566147804260254,0.8291488885879517,0.6670092940330505,0.8245811462402344,0.8208481669425964

150469,Logan,2017-03-10,5,"Logan is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Speaking as a film fanatic who owns thousands of comic books\, that isn't something that I would say lightly. It is both bewildering and stunning that this was made by the same director (James Mangold) that made The Wolverine. It's bewildering that the man was hired again and it's stunning that he made something this good. It would be like if Batman & Robin and Batman Begins were made by the same guy. The leap in quality is that big.\n \n	I use the term \""superhero movie\"" here more for the sake of convenience than as an accurate description. This isn't a superhero movie in the traditional sense. In fact\, it could easily be rewritten as a general action movie or even a western without any connections to the X-Men. I don't mean that in a negative way\, rather just to illustrate that this stretches the genre in a way that is rarely seen outside of comics themselves. The plot is basically that of a road trip movie. Wolverine and Professor X are now shadows of their former selves and live in a near future (2029\, I think) when all other mutants are gone and a new one hasn't been born in decades. That changes when they cross paths with a young girl (also known as X-23) that has powers oddly similar to those of Wolverine. They then embark on a trip to a rumored mutant sanctuary in North Dakota while being pursued by mercenary-types that want to get ahold of X-23.\n \nI am normally a stickler for plot continuity in franchise films\, but this is actually a case where I find it refreshing that the movie couldn't seem to care less about that. Regardless of how you feel about the other X-Men/Wolverine films\, we can likely agree that the continuity has become convoluted at this point. Hell\, Deadpool even made a joke about it (Is it Stewart or McAvoy? Where are we in the timeline?). Logan gets around that by simply not giving a shit. It picks and chooses references to previous movies without concern for continuity\, but rather with the sole intention of ensuring that this story works as a standalone film. That would usually irritate me\, but it works here. And it pays off.\n\n	The tone of this movie is perfect. Completely eschewing the more light-hearted adventures of the X-Men\, Logan takes place in a bleak and brutally violent world that feels like a different universe from what came before it. If you watched the previous films and wished Wolverine could go berserk without the limitations of a PG-13 rating\, then holy shit will you get your wish. Heads are chopped off\, limbs fly everywhere and people are shot in the face. Characters that you think are safe are quickly eviscerated. However\, it is not dark for the sake of being dark and this tone fits Wolverine (unlike\, say\, Superman or Fantastic Four). It isn't a cynical film\, either. The violence and tone are required for this subject matter and develop organically; it isn't there because someone took an old Wolverine script and stuffed some extra violence in it. And even among the darkness and violence\, there are some sweet and funny moments too. The characters are not mere cannon fodder; I actually cared when people died in this movie.\n \n	If the Academy Awards were actually about movies and not political causes\, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart would both be nominated for their performances. Jackman portrays Logan as a grizzled\, burnt out man that has seen some shit and drowns his memories with whisky. It's an incredibly effective and often poignant performance that reminded me of Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven. Stewart gets some of the funniest lines in the film\, but also brings an aura of sadness that permeates through the film. He plays a man that knows that he is on his last legs and wants to do something right to make up for his past. All of this is unusually heavy stuff for a comic book movie\, but it works without feeling forced. Dafne Keen\, the young girl that plays X-23\, is also excellent. I don't think I've ever seen a pre-teen girl seem this intimidating and the physicality of the role is impressive. Hoping to see her career continue in the coming years.\n \n	If I have one gripe about the film\, it's that the villains aren't particularly interesting or memorable. But the main characters are so well done that I don't really care. I have also heard some people nitpick about differences between the film and the comics. Those people need to let it go. Not everything in a comic can work on screen\, for both artistic and logistical reasons\, and even the best adaptations take liberties with the source material. I am not particularly knowledgeable about the X-Men comics\, but I really can't imagine that being a huge issue unless you are just looking for something to bitch about.\n\n	I expected to like this movie\, but I didn't expect to like it this much. Even halfway through\, I kept waiting for something to ruin it. Maybe a villain in a samurai mech suit would show up or Wolverine would get a comic relief sidekick. But no\, none of that happened. It's both sad and irritating that this is (supposedly) the last ride for Jackman and Stewart in these roles\, because it made me realize just how much better these movies could have been all along. But one great Wolverine movie is better than none and franchise swansongs don't get much better than this.",True,0.9138222932815552,0.8881224393844604,0.8788520097732544,0.8912506699562073,0.8899856209754944,0.9068176746368408,0.8774826526641846,0.9080139994621277,0.891967236995697

150485,Logan,2017-03-01,5,"LOGAN is set in 2029 where mutant population has diminished and X-Men have dispersed. Logan now drinks heavily\, his healing power is dwindling and earns for a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of old Professor X who he keeps hidden away in a town on the Mexican Border. One day\, a stranger woman asks him to drive the a girl\, named Laura to the Canadian border. He refuses\, Charles insists and tells him that Laura is what he's been waiting for. Laura possesses with an extraordinary power in many ways like Wolverine.\n\nLogan\, reunites James Mangold and Hugh Jackman who collaborated in a couple of movies (Kate and Leopold 2001) and the recent The Wolverine movie in (2013) which was based on a Japanese Wolverine saga but this year's Logan is a western Wolverine. This is what I like about shared universe. The X-Men universe was brilliantly explored by Mangold and what he brings us is exceptional and gritty approach on Wolverine's character\, the Wolverine movie we've been waiting for an awful long time. Logan is probably one of the best examples how western films fascinates him as a filmmaker.\n\nWhen it was first announced that there was going to be a sequel or lets say\, last Wolverine film with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine\, Mangold has said in his interview that LOGAN was going to be different. And when he said different\, it has to be unexpected. And it was shockingly good. I felt overwrought when I left the theater\, I couldn't speak and I was thinking a lot about it the whole time till I got home. The tone and the elements I've witnessed in the entire film was so unexpected. God\, it was gore and brutal in exceptional way. There's blood anywhere\, but the violence we've seen in the entire film has purposes. And the way it was presented in the film is what we needed from Wolverine's character. We didn't get to see it in previous X-Men films and that is what makes Logan so special film. Logan has simply raised the bar of what a superhero movie could do. It is so tough to compare it to any other X-Men films we've seen in the past years 'cause Logan knew exactly what it wanted to be. One of the best standalone superhero films I've seen in years.\n\nNot every actor can act heavy dramatic scenes with a kid. But Hugh Jackman can. Wolverine is one of the greatest comic book characters we grew up with and when we talk about Wolverine you gonna need that caliber of acting to embody him. And Jackman hits out of the park. Jackman gives an incredible and unforgettable work as Logan. This is probably one of the very best performances of his career and his best portrayal as Wolverine.\n\nOne of the things I like about this film is the character development. The relationship between Logan and Professor X was exceptional and that makes us feel for them even more. Patrick Stewart's comeback as Professor Charles was one of the reason's why I got very excited to see this film. Dafne Keen gives an amazing performance as Laura Kinney. She doesn't talk that much in the film\, but her expressive face tells us clearly what she feels. And it's kinda difficult as an actor to interact with other characters with your facial expression\, but this kid can.\n\nBoyd Holbrook who is probably one of the most underrated actors working today gives an effective work as Donald Pierce. This guy knows how to embody a character and make it his own\, as the one of the antagonists in the film. The action sequences were gorgeously choreographed. The pacing of the film was just necessary\, it gives us time to learn the characters and it enhances the emotional stand point of the film and that's why we care about them and we feel for them. The musical score of the film feels so old western which is what they're aiming for.\n\nOver all\, LOGAN is riveting and great in its own right. It is satisfying conclusion to Wolverine's character\, filled with some of the best action sequences I've seen in a comic book movie and great performances.\n\nPlease DO NOT wait to see it on a device you can hold in your hand.

150486,Logan,2017-02-20,5,"Logan is something new in the field of comic book films. It's a serious important\, and thoroughly moving film with some more matured ideas and themes than you average superhero movie. The films discusses more important themes and has a lot of emotional substance. Logan is a beautiful\, sombre\, touching\, brutal\, dark and tragic film\, one that truly redefines superhero films. In fact\, it bares little resemblance to most of the genre\, and though there are plenty of gritty\, thrilling action sequences scattered throughout\, the film feels more like sombre\, touching drama with bursts of explosive action in between.\n\nThe opening scene immediately establishes the mood of the film\, with an old Logan(Hugh Jackman) waking up in his limo\, one that he drives to earn cash nowadays\, to find a few hoodlums trying to steal the car's wheels. After being beaten quite a bit\, Logan loses his cool and slices up 3 of the hoodlums with his claws. The film shows very clearly that Logan is not the man he once was\, and has been consumed with regret\, grief and depression. This is shown brilliantly in Logan's physical movements\, attitude and fighting style. The world is shown as a depressing one\, where there are no more mutants and no more heroes. Logan is no longer Wolverine\, and is now laying low down by the Mexican border where he and the albino mutant Caliban(Stephen Merchant) care for an Alzheimer-stricken\, ailing Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart)\, who is prone to sudden seizures\, resulting in a potentially fatal psychic shock wave\, incapacitating everyone but Logan. As the film goes on\, and I won't dive much further into the plot\, Logan discovers that he has a daughter by the name of Laura(Dafne Keen) and must protect her from dark forces lead by the ruthless Donald Pierce(Boyd Holbrook).\n\nThe dynamics between Logan\, his daughter Laura and Charles are compelling and extremely well-defined\, with a variety of touching character moments bolstered by a script with lots of emotional substance. Most of characters are very well fleshed-out with complex and compelling characterisation. The film explores themes such as mortality\, regret and fatherhood which are uncommon in many superhero pictures. The cinematography is bleak\, but beautiful nonetheless and highly well edited. The action sequences are extremely violent\, but also well-handled so that they feel real. They are fluid\, intense and very hard-hitting. The extreme blood and gore shows us the true consequences of Logan's powers and how\, regardless of whether they are used for good or not\, people\, real people\, are hurt and killed. Also\, the fact that Logan is tired\, weary\, old and truly past his prime\, adds to the tension of each fight\, with him often getting kicked around a lot\, before unleashing his inner beast.\n\nThe performances are brilliant throughout\, with Hugh Jackman giving one of the best on-screen performances in recent years. His acting is subtle\, gritty\, nuanced and truly believable. Dafne Keen\, playing X-23/Laura is also very impressive in her film debut as the young mutant daughter of Wolverine. Throughout the film\, she speaks very few words throughout the picture but communicates a lot of emotion and expression through her facial expressions.Sir Patrick Stewart is as always brilliant in his role\, but gives a slightly different performance to his usual as Charles Xavier\, and Stephen Merchant shines in what little screen time he gets as Caliban. Boyd Holbrook delivers his lines very well and gives a very good\, menacing performance overall.The music is also beautiful\, setting the tone for the film perfectly. Richard E. Grant does very well as Xander Rice. My one and only complaint on Logan lies with the villains\, because they often seem somewhat generic and underdeveloped. However\, the inclusion of X-24 ( a savage\, mindless evil clone of Wolverine) makes for some impressive action sequences and showcases an interesting parallel as to what would happen if Logan was to let go of all his humanity. It also serves as a metaphor for Logan's inner battle against the savage version of himself that has been kept dormant almost his entire life.\n\nThe final few scenes of the movie show Logan dying at the hands (or claws) of his evil counterpart X-24. It shows 24 impaling Logan on a tree\, and right before delivering the final blow\, having his head blown apart by an adamantium bullet fired by Laura. As Logan succumbs to his wounds\, he expresses a sort of satisfaction in facing his own mortality as demonstrated by the line \""so this is what it feels like\"". Logan's death\, I feel\, is handled extremely well\, with the titular sharing a few blissful moments bonding with his daughter before dying peacefully. It is truly beautiful\, but also very sorrowful\,and is one of the few moments in all of cinematic history to bring me to tears.\n\nAlso\, there is a truly awesome berserker rage scene at the end of the film where Logan cuts\, stabs and slashes his way through dozens of Pierce's men\, which is what fans have wanted to see for the past 17 years\n\nLogan is a brilliant film\, one that subverts expectations in every way. It's serious\, thoughtful\, emotional and at times truly touching. The film is a wonderful final goodbye and swan-song to the character after 17 years. Goodbye\, Logan.

'Logan' is again directed by Mangold\, who did the previous film ('The Wolverine') and is set in 2029 - when Logan/James Howlett is ~200 and Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) is ~90. They do a great job of making them both look and seem way older than their appearances in the last few films!

Getting to see his healing-factor wane and have to face his mortality\, as well as reluctantly be the good guy\, is all true to character and pulled off expertly by Jackman. It's long (2.25 hours)\, with lots of nice\, character-building moments - particularly with the family at the farm house. Keen is good as Laura and Merchant has a nice role as Caliban.

150517,Logan,2016-12-17,5,"Logan is the last film in the trilogy of Wolverine films\, but also marks Hugh Jackman's last performance as Wolverine in the X-Men universe. The film also marks Patrick Stewarts last outing as Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men universe. So\, how does this last outing film hold up? Is it good\, is it bad\, is it ok? Let's dive into it\, shall we?\n \nOff of first impressions\, I am completely blown away by this film. It is totally different than any X-Men\, heck any Wolverine film before it! Hugh Jackman himself did an absolutely beautiful job on this film. I could tell that he literally put everything into this film and it definitely does show in this film as well. Patrick Stewarts portrayal of a aging and trash talking Charles Xavier was hilarious but at times really touching. I honestly felt that the two\, Jackman and Stewart\, were a great pairing for this film. But it was interesting how with this film being rather serious and very brutal\, oh so brutal\, there were comedic moments that actually within that type of story. When a film can do that\, do it successfully that is\, I am always impressed\, as I am with this film. The girl who played X-23 was also extremely good. For a kid actor\, she was very good within this R rated film. There are so many other actors who played their roles extremely well\, but everyone really did a great job.\n \nThe story was also very touching\, saying it's technically about the last days of Wolverine. The characters within it all serve there purpose\, and honestly I don't feel that any character was wasted at all. Every person had a reason for being on screen\, and it made the story that much better because of it. Essentially\, the story arch is a road trip\, so we meet different people\, while Logan is being pursued by\, basically\, Mutant hunters. X-23 and Logan do not get a long at first\, but as the film progresses\, they do form a strong bond. The plot line with Xavier was also very interesting. Through it we learn what has happened in the past 15-20 years. We also learn of what he is capable of now and what effects it has\, which just saying\, is extremely bad. The whole plot line for X-23 was also interesting and very close to Wolverines backstory\, which makes sense when you think about it. So story wise\, really on point.\n \nAction wise\, holy crap. When there was action\, there was action. I'm glad this film was rated R because to fully see what Wolverine and even X-23 were capable of\, it had to be done in a R rated film. A PG-13 film could not do this justice\, it wouldn't even come close. The kills in this film are also extremely brutal. I mean\, rated R brutal\, and by that I mean so brutal that it's not for the weak hearted at all! You have limbs and heads and everything getting cut-off\, so\, yeah\, action and killings extremely brutal\, but extremely awesome as well.\n \nThe final thing I want to touch on is the mutant hunting group. Headed by Richard E. Grant's character\, they claim that they can control mutants by killing them and mixing tissues together. There's one thing they make that I won't spoil\, that probably could've been left out\, but at the same time\, it was actually pretty awesome to see. The man with the metal hand too was a loyal servant for the mutant hunters\, and he had a few moments where he was pretty clever. And the interesting bit is\, if you remember the original X-Men films\, apparently this group is based off the same program that gave Logan his claws\, heck it runs in the family\, not going to explain how though\, you gotta see the film to find out.\n \nOverall though\, when it comes down to how good this film really was\, it was the best X-Menish film Fox has made for awhile. The direction behind it\, the acting\, the story\, everything\, was just perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better film. Logan is truly a great film and I highly recommend that everyone\, who is above 18\, no kids\, go see this film and witness the last chapter in The Wolverine and Professor X story.

150518,Logan,2017-03-02,5,"Logan is the last installment of the Wolverine trilogy that will feature Hugh Jackman as the titular character. It's directed by James Mangold\, who also directed the 2013's The Wolverine which I thought was great and a step in the right direction after the mess that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Logan is the first X-Men movie to be rated R\, unless you count the extended edition of The Wolverine which\, compared to Logan\, is a G-rated movie. The story follows an old\, weathered down and miserable Logan who works as a limo driver and is keeping Charles Xavier in hiding from the villains. Logan gets a job offer to drive a woman\, Gabriela\, and her \""daughter\""\, Laura\, to Eden\, a safe haven for mutants. As expected\, Laura is a mutant that Gabriela rescued from a hospital in which they experimented on her. Gabriela thinks that map coordinates from an X-Men comicbook will lead them to\, the already mentioned\, Eden. Logan doesn't want anything to do with her\, but after she offers a large sum of money\, he accepts and thus starts the plot. I won't go into large details during this review\, but I will most certainly have to explore some of the plot points and character choices\, so here's a warning that some spoilers may follow! First of all\, Logan is amazingly brutal! I couldn't believe my eyes. I went to see this with a friend and we were both stunned at the level of gore that they showed in this movie. This is the most brutal comicbook movie I've ever witnessed and I can't describe how happy I was to finally see Wolverine cut limbs\, behead people and much\, much more. I had a constant smile on my face\, I felt such relief and I can't thank Deadpool enough for being such a box office success! I'm positive that if it weren't for Deadpool\, we wouldn't be getting such an explicit movie. The violence is all CG\, though. It's on the level of Deadpool\, the animation. It looks exactly the same\, there's just much more of it here in Logan. I didn't mind a second of it\, though. It looked real enough and it didn't took me out of the movie\, so all is good. Great\, in fact! There's one scene which literally made my jaw drop\, I still can't believe they had the courage to do it. If you've seen the movie\, you know exactly which scene I'm talking about. People online\, also\, seem to be losing their heads about it. Secondly\, this is a beautifully directed movie! I wasn't expecting the movie to look this beautiful. Judging by the trailer\, the scenery looked pretty repetitive and dull\, but having seen the movie\, I'm very surprised. Everything looks so gorgeous! The sequence where X-24 enters the movie is the most horrifying sequence I've ever seen in a comicbook movie. It's the stuff of nightmares. Thirdly\, the acting is absolutely fantastic! Everyone shines in this movie\, even the newcomer Dafnee Keen as the child mutant\, Laura. Laura doesn't speak until the last 30-40 minutes of the movie\, but even so\, she delivers a stellar performance for a child actor who's never acted in a feature length movie before. Hugh Jackman's last outing as Logan/Wolverine is phenomenal. This version of Logan is unlike anything we've seen before. In this movie\, he's on the bottom and there's no hope left for him. Logan continues to prove how Hugh Jackman is the perfect casting choice for Wolverine and I\, personally\, don't want them to ever touch this character again in the future movies. I want this to really be the last Wolverine movie and that noone replaces Hugh Jackman as the character. Hugh Jackman was Wolverine for 17 years now\, ever since the first X-Men movie came out\, and to replace him would be blasphemous. Same goes for Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier. Stellar casting choices all around. Xavier that we see in this movie is\, much like Logan\, on the bottom. He's suffering from some heavy brain disease (it's mentioned it could be ALS or Alzheimer's but is never confirmed) and suffers from seizures that cause him to release a lot of his power\, and paralyze the people around him. This leads to one very intense and mindblowing sequence in a hotel that just needs to be seen. Boyd Holbrook as Pierce was good. He plays the villain and\, although Boyd does a great job\, the character just isn't too intriguing or menacing. He just follows Logan and co. around and never does anything menacing himself. He always brings someone with him to do that for him which makes his character seem more like a coward and not an entertaining villain. The soundtrack is great\, especially in the\, before mentioned\, X-24 entrance sequence. I can't begin to describe how perfect that scene is. The story does suffer from some awkward exposition scenes. The standout exposition scene is when Logan watches a video on Gabriela's mobile phone which explains the entire history and experiments done on children-mutants in the hospital from where she saved Laura. It's at first a video of just Gabriela talking in to the camera\, but then proceeds to show footage shot in the facility with a voice-over. It looks as if someone has edited the entire video\, adding in a bunch of footage that looked impossible to film for Gabriela. It's the laziest method of letting the viewers find out important plot points and I can't look past it. Thankfuly\, this is the only scene that I had problems with in the movie. The rest of the movie is pure gold\, if you ask me. The ending is undescribably depressing and it made me tear up a lot. All in all\, Logan is an exceptional movie with terrific performances\, very strong brutal violence and a plot that is so mature and depressing that I couldn't believe this was a movie set in the X-Men universe. It's unlike any \""superhero\"" movie I've ever seen before\, and I don't think anything like this will come out in the future. It's a one-of-a-kind movie that I would definitely recommend! Even with some exposition problems\, I can't not give this movie a perfect score. It did everything I wanted it to and more. I can't stress enough how perfect this movie was!",True,0.305155485868454,0.3062257170677185,0.2752681374549866,0.30218419432640076,0.26545625925064087,0.28484728932380676,0.3083418309688568,0.30594125390052795,0.27131742238998413
150519,Logan,2017-03-17,3,"\""Logan\"" is the last Wolverine movie starring Hugh Jackman. In this film\, Logan and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) have to protect a young mutant from abduction and harm by an organization that genetically modifies children to make them into soldiers. I had issues with this film. While engaging\, it also suffers from plot continuity issues that make no sense given events in the Marvel universe. It is also heavy-handed and unnecessarily dark and brooding. The pacing has issues\, and the violence detracts from what could have been a more relevant story. The villains are amorphous\, and Patrick Stewart does not play an adequate foil for Jackman.

Set some time in the future\, the x-men are gone and Logan and Caliban\, another mutant\, are hiding out on the Mexican border and caring for Charles Xavier\, who has a deteriorating brain disease. When a woman approaches Logan asking for help they finding themselves heading north to help an extraordinary young girl. This is the strongest\, bloodiest and most heartfelt X-Men film to date. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart excel in their roles and make years of watching their characters develop and change over the course of so many films feel worthwhile. Stephen Merchant is very good as Caliabn and Dafne Keen is excellent as Laura\, giving a powerful and emotional performance and performing a lot of her stunts herself. The fight scenes themselves are very well done\, bloody and well choreographed without the use of shaky cam which makes them very enjoyable to watch.   \nAll in all this is\, in my opinion\, one of the best super hero films I've ever seen and if this were the last X-Men film ever made\, you couldn't ask for a better conclusion.",True,0.09939505904912949,0.12972047924995422,0.020412901416420937,0.08888817578554153,0.017214564606547356,0.08505062013864517,0.02142053283751011,0.09106273949146271,0.09024486690759659
150523,Logan,2017-03-05,4,"Logan is the latest movie in the X-Men universe focussing on fan-favourite Wolverine\, played for the final time by Hugh Jackman. In the far-off future of 2029\, there are no mutants left\, save for a small handful struggling to survive. The film takes a very different approach to any of it's franchise predecessors\, allowing it to stand out as one of best in the series so far. \n\nFirst appearing in 2000's X-Men\, Hugh Jackman has become loved across the world for the role of Wolverine\, making this final appearance an emotional one. Jackman knocks it out of the park\, convincingly playing a broken and disturbed Logan trapped in the hell that is the future. It's heartbreaking to see such a loved character in the state he is in\, making the movie all the more investing. \n\nJoining Jackman is the legendary Sir Patrick Stewart\, also retiring his role as Charles Xavier. Stewart helps to break the audience's hearts a little more\, showing the dangers of when the world's most dangerous mind becomes senile. To complete the small band of struggling mutants is comedian Stephen Merchant\, unexpectedly managing to pull of the serious character of Caliban. Of course\, one of the most excellent additions to the film is 11 year old Dafne Keen as new mutant X-23\, a character who many comic fans will be very\, very excited to see. Child actors can always be a bit of a risk but Keen nails the tone with just the right mix of childish innocence and bad-assery. \n\nThe director\, James Mangold\, will hopefully have redeemed himself in the eyes of many for 2013's The Wolverine with this beautifully shot film. The drab and dusty colour palate evokes a Mad Max-esque post-apocalyptic world with beautiful sweeping shots of the desert landscapes. The R-rating is certainly made use of\, with frequent swears and a surprising amount of blood and violence to give Deadpool a run for its money. While this may put off younger viewers\, it works to the film's favour to show the brutality of the world the characters inhabit. \n\nHowever\, like every film\, it is not without its floors. As is so common with superhero films\, the villains are a weak spot. Richard E. Grant's evil professor\, Xander Rice\, feels awfully underused and could have a little more screen time. The gang of thuggish 'Reavers'\, while certainly adding tension to the chase scenes of the film\, could have had been fleshed out more\, such as paying attention to the cybernetic enhancements of the character's comic book equivalents. The explanation as to why there are no other mutants is also fairly quickly glanced over and could be easily missed\, so some more time on the subject would help make he film more accessible. \n\nOverall\, the film is incredibly well made and the most entertaining and emotional way to say goodbye to Wolverine and Professor X\, after 17 years joining them in their adventures. After last year's disappointing X-Men: Apocalypse\, Logan is a new high point for the franchise\, making the loss all the more devastating. As well as this\, the R-rating certainly makes for an interesting new look at the series and is worth checking out just for that. Logan is definitely one you don't want to miss out on\, and there is no better way to bid farewell to the Wolverine\, bub.",True,0.4721206724643707,0.432021826505661,0.3199939429759979,0.4986199140548706,0.4771274924278259,0.44668272137641907,0.36750906705856323,0.5152564644813538,0.43776121735572815
150524,Logan,2017-07-13,5,"Logan is the latest X-Men film starring Hugh Jackman in his final portrayal as Wolverine. It's also\, the first movie featuring Wolverine to be Rated R. This movie is one of the darkest and deepest comic book films since The Dark Knight. Director James Mangold (The Wolverine) returns and writes Logan for an awesome end to Hugh Jackman's 17-year career as everyone's favorite X-Men character.\n\n        The story loosely adapts one of the best storylines\, \""Old Man Logan.\"" Logan is old and beaten down. All of his fellow X-Men comrades are gone. He's also trying to take care of his father figure Charles Xavier from bizarre seizures. In his final adventure\, Logan has to protect a girl named Laura\, who has abilities just like him\, from the government who are after her.\n\n        Hugh Jackman gave his best for last to show how deep and complex Wolverine became after all these years. He still has that rage and aggression inside of him. Same goes with Laura\, played by Dafne Keen. She's fun to watch every time on screen. Patrick Stewart gives a gripping performance as Charles Xavier. He's weak\, his powers are useless\, and shattered. Charles at this point is basically crippled\, which is something never seen before in the comics.\n\n        Logan has barely any hope. You're watching not just an action flick starring Wolverine\, but also a serious drama at the same time. There is some humor added\, but it's not like a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie where everything is bright and fun for everybody. No\, 20th Century Fox's take on with their movies is focusing more on the adult audience. In fact\, I don't recall any children today knowing the X-Men. One\, they're not in the MCU\, and two\, no toys or action figures to sell for the kids.\n\n        As I said before\, this movie is rated R. So much blood and gore throughout. Some people may say this was a bad choice. Well\, to be fair\, the Wolverine comics are pretty dark. Similar to Deadpool\, the murk with the mouth\, not made for kids whatsoever\, since that was Rated R as well. By the way parents\, do not bring your kids to see blood and guts. That's not in their blood. No pun intended.\n\n        The action is really\, really good. These are some of the best action I've seen in the X-Men films\, mostly no CGI is spotted. This means no cars flying\, no robots destroying mutants\, none of that is found in Logan at all. You can barely even tell if it is CGI or not. Wolverine goes beserk one everyone\, by stabbing them in the face\, chopping people's heads off\, it's the perfect family film of the year.\n\n        Everything is great about Logan. However\, it does have some flaws. For one\, the villains are poorly developed. I really thought Omega Red was set to be the villain as thet said. Instead\, we have Donald Pierce\, portrayed by Boyd Holbrook. How did he recieved that robotic hand? The big boss revealing sucked as well. Don't worry\, I won't spoil it\, but it would've been a great twist if it were someone we knew from a previous movie. Never developed\, never explained\, nothing more\, nothing less.\n\n        Overall\, Logan is a tremendous action/drama movie for the adult audience. Here's what I have to say to Hugh Jackman. Thank you for bringing one of the best superhero portrayals ever. Without you as Wolverine\, we wouldn't had this long running franchise that first started in 2000. See you around\, bub.

150540,Logan,2016-11-02,5,"Logan is the tenth instalment in the X-men franchise and marks the final performances for Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart as both Logan/Wolverine and Professor X. Both Jackman and Stewart both starred in the original X-men movie released 17 years ago so having this as their final film of the franchise meant a lot. This film is directed by James Mangold who previously directed films like 3:10 to Yuma\, Walk the Line and 2013's underrated The Wolverine. Logan is a truly fantastic film that is an absolute breath of fresh air for the both the X-men films and also superhero films in general. A lot like 2008's masterpiece The Dark Knight\, Logan feels more like a gritty drama with superhero elements than a comic book movie through and through. Logan is such a refreshing movie as it doesn't have to set up a big universe or however many future movies\, instead it tells its own contained story which I loved. There are so many positives to talk about but the acting is one of the biggest. Hugh Jackman has been playing this role for 17 years and has been in every X-men film\, except for Deadpool\, in some shape or form. In Logan his performance is the culmination of all those years and Jackman gives probably the best performance of his career. He plays a dramatic\, broken man who is a shell of what we saw in the first movie and Jackman puts his all into it. I've seen some people says his performance is Oscar worthy and while it unfortunately won't happen it is a one hundred percent correct statement. Patrick Stewart also gives a fantastic performance. In the previous X-men movies he was such a warm and positive figure but in Logan he gives a tragic and heartbreaking performance. New comer Dafne Keen stars as Laura and considering its her first real performance she's fantastic\, she's both violent and funny and I loved her character. Boyd Holbrook stars as the villain Donald Pearce and I actually thought he was really good. True he's not the best villain ever but he's very charismatic and fairly menacing and I think he's one of the more underrated aspects of this movie. Stephen Merchant also stars as Caliban and while at first I thought it was bizarre casting he's surprisingly perfect in the role. Richard E Grant also stars as a supporting villain and while he does a pretty good job at being menacing and creepy\, he's so underused and the weakest of the villains. There's also some a lot of very good acting from the minor characters like Eriq La Salle and Elizabeth Rodriquez. The direction from James Mangold is absolutely fantastic. He's able to make Logan both a somber and bleak movie but also sprinkle in some good dry humour and some really top notch action sequences. The writing is also excellent and there are lots of really clever and inventive set pieces in the film that I was honestly holding my breath at. The film also has a lot of tragedy to it especially from Patrick Stewart who has some moments that will likely bring you to tears. The ending of the film is absolutely fantastic and while it isn't the best end action sequence in a movie it doesn't matter as it's an emotional rollercoaster. I honestly think this has one of the saddest and most emotional blockbuster endings I have seen in years. The film isn't all doom and gloom however as the action is truly spectacular. The wolverine centred action sequences in the previous X-men movies while great felt quite restrained by the PG-13 ratings\, especially the sequence in X-men Apocalypse\, however that is not the case with Logan. The action here is unbelievably gruesome and brutal which I absolutely loved. While watching Wolverine and Laura/X-23 slice up villains is incredibly amazing to watch there are also some really unique twists on the action. There's a car chase that feels much more grounded and realistic in comparison to other car chases. There's also a truly fantastic hotel room sequence that is very inventive\, gory and has an extremely emotional climax. However Logan isn't a film reliant on action or special effects it's a truly emotional character story that feels so different and unique for a superhero movie. Technically Logan is absolutely fantastic. The film looks amazing with fantastic cinematography and visuals by John Mathieson. The musical score by Marco Beltrami is very good. True it's not quite as excellent as Beltrami's previous score for the Wolverine or Henry Jackman's score for X-men First Class\, it's still a great score. One thing I was really pleased about with Logan is it's editing. While the film is a hefty 2 hours 17 minutes it isnt ever boring. The film has a slower pace than your average superhero movie I really think it's fits the film well. Unlike other superhero movies like Batman v Superman\, Suicide Squad\, X-men Apocalypse\, The Amazing Spider-Man 2\, Avengers Age of Ultron\, Fant4stic and many others Logan doesn't feel like it's been hacked to bits in the editing room or that the studio forced James Mangold to remove about half of the movie. It really is fantastic to see a superhero movie that doesn't feel the need to set up a billion other movies but actually take its time to tell a contained story. Logan is an absolutely fantastic movie however it's does have a couple of problems. There is an exposition dump at the start of the movie involving a video recording on a phone that feels a bit contrived and like countless found footage movies you do ask why the person wouldn't just turn off the camera. Also as mentioned before Richard E. Grant's villain is weak and his exit from the film is very unsatisfying. He has one scene towards the end where he starts to get interesting but it's cut short to soon. However that's really it as Logan is a comic book movie for the ages. An absolutely fantastic film that tells an emotionally draining yet powerful story. It actually has some important themes and messages. The action is amazing\, the acting is mesmerising and the direction is truly excellent. It's a film that I can't wait to watch again and I honestly think will go on to become a classic of the superhero genre. This is probably my second favourite X-men movie\, just slightly behind X-men First Class which is really saying something as there are quite a few truly exceptional X-men movie. Logan is the perfect end to Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's X-men run and I'm so glad they both went out on such a high. Go see Logan wether you are a fan of X-men or not it's truly amazing.

150564,Logan,2017-03-07,5,"Logan (Jackman) is an old man: wounded\, tired\, hurt in more ways than he cares to know. His body has aged\, his expressions\, transformed and twisted\, his adamantium claws rusted with coagulated blood. Time has not been kind to the once aptly named 'Wolverine' and he lives in a world where mutants have stopped existing for decades. His closest friends are an albino mutant named Caliban (wonderfully played by Stephen Merchant) and an aging\, Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)\, suffering from a degenerative brain disease that has the ability to wipe out those in proximity to him. Caliban helps Logan care for Xavier until enough money can be raised for a boat in which they can live out the rest of their days. At least\, that's the plan until a mysterious woman crosses Logan's path and forces an exceptionally gifted young girl named Laura (Dafne keen) on him\, who is much more than she seems. An agent (Boyd Holbrook) is soon dispatched to retrieve her and a bloody\, merciless\, treacherous\, and endearing tale unfolds as the sun slowly sets on the legend of the Wolverine.\n\nDirector James Mangold effectively humanizes the world of Logan with a story that feels closer to the ground than the last\, over the top entries in the X-Men franchise. Logan wears heavy on the soul and is heavily paced\, often picking at audiences core with profound amounts of violence and emotion grit\, particularly in exchanges between Logan and Xavier and then between Logan and Laura. The violence itself is dialed all the way to 11 as Mangold continually finds new and improved ways to plant claws into all sorts of different body parts and often surprises even the most vetted X-Men fan. Hugh Jackman truly cuts loose\, giving movie goers an astonishing and impactful last performance as Logan\, no doubt leaving gigantic shoes for future \""Wolverines\"" to fill. Of course\, those shoes could easily be filled by the dynamite Dafne Keen with her dramatic debut as Laura/X-23\, a mutant whose abilities mirror those of the former Wolverine. What is most impressive is the way in which both Jackman and Keen are able to bring audiences to their level and make their pain our own. Their world is fractured by pain\, molded in metal\, and they long to break free of their constraints\, seeking peace in life or peace in death. Stewart's broken and old Professor Charles Xavier acts as the perfect conduit between Logan and Laura\, connecting them with a family-like approach as he once did with the children of his long forgotten School for the Gifted. Merchant and Holbrook also act as an unprecedented breath of fresh air\, balancing comedic elements in story with excellent acting during tense and emotional scenes.\n\nCombining top notch performances\, thrilling and blood filled action sequences\, an emotionally heartbreaking story\, and once again raising the bar for comic book adaptations\, Logan stands as the best of the X-Men films in the entire franchise. And although it can be a melancholy ride for some\, Logan ultimately rewards them with a proper send off for both Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Hugh Jackman's Logan in story\, in visual\, and in spirit.

Logan is as true to the source material as one could ever hope.  I only wish Mr. Hugh Jackman could have been free to take the character to this depth sooner. My only hope is that Logan will forever set the bar for the next incarnation.

150575,Logan,2017-03-11,4,"LOGAN marks Hugh Jackman's final time (so he says\, anyway) portraying the character on film\, and if that holds true\, there can be no more fitting cap to his time as Wolverine.  LOGAN is a heavy and dramatic film\, far from a blast or a lark\, but it is deeply effective as a character study with distinct western influences.\n\nLittle needs to be said about the plot\, so I'll leave that for others to elaborate upon.  Centrally\, LOGAN concerns the relationship between the titular character\, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)\, and Laura (Dafne Keen)\, a young mutant with abilities eerily similar to Logan's.  The two men are not in a good place\, having been thoroughly beaten down by events off-screen\, but they see in Laura - who is being pursued by sinister forces - a chance at a sort of redemption.  This narrative gives the movie the feeling of being one part western\, one part road trip movie\, and one part superhero elegy.  There's a mournful and bittersweet quality here\, something rarely found in comic book adaptations\, and that quality lends the tale a sense of weight which makes Jackman's swan song land with even more impact than it would have had LOGAN been just another colorful confection.  The movie is very hard-edged\, almost to the point that its ultra-violence and coarse language begin to feel a bit gimmicky.  Nevertheless\, it ultimately feels appropriate for the story that director James Mangold and his co-writers wanted to tell.\n\nAs Logan\, Hugh Jackman is absolutely fantastic.  The weary\, wounded quality he brings to life here is perfectly fitting for the character\, and his work in this movie is arguably the best he's yet given us.  Anywhere\, in any film.  This is an Oscar-worthy performance.  He's matched by Patrick Stewart\, who brings new angles and shades to Professor X\, showing him now to be a man wracked with guilt but still trying to bring out the best in Wolverine.  The third member of the central triumvirate\, Dafne Keen\, is quite a discovery\, delivering a coiled\, ferocious\, and emotional turn.  The acting from these three alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nHowever\, with all that said\, LOGAN is not the complete masterwork many have been rushing to proclaim it to be.  What keeps it from reaching the absolute top tier of the comic book movie canon?  A few things\, actually.  First\, the admirable (and wonderful) emphasis on the main characters' interplay and relationships has a side effect - the villains are not drawn particularly well\, nor do they leave much of an impression; these are very standard action movie heavies\, characters who exist to fulfill plot functions\, not to have rounded and interesting stories of their own (though\, to his credit\, Boyd Holbook does his damnedest to invest his character with personality).  And look\, the movie is called LOGAN\, after all\, not LOGAN'S VILLAINS\, so I hesitate to really hold the lukewarm antagonists against the film too much\, but I can't help thinking that this would be an even better\, stronger film if Wolverine had some worthy opponents to deal with alongside the nameless henchmen he murders his way through. \n\nThe movie's bigger problem for me is (interestingly) one which probably won't bother too many others\, and that's the issue of continuity.  The X-Men franchise has always been incredibly lax when it comes to making sure that all the details of the various films line up and don't contradict\, and that's not really my concern with LOGAN.  What does bother me is the way in which this film essentially undoes the \""victory\"" of the previous Wolverine-centric X-Men movie\, DAYS OF FUTURE PAST; that film ends with our primary heroes happy\, and in a bright and optimistic future.  LOGAN - set a couple years after that ending - returns Logan and Professor X to a dreadful\, rough existence.  While that makes appropriate thematic sense for LOGAN's driving character concerns\, it does basically render DAYS OF FUTURE PAST's ending something of a meaningless joke.\n\nAll of that is mostly overshadowed by the fact that LOGAN is as fitting a sendoff for the character as you could ask for.  It's often dour tone may be too much for some\, but those interested in a rich and thoughtful conclusion to Wolverine's story will find much here to appreciate.",True,0.8015403747558594,0.7845665216445923,0.7494535446166992,0.786116361618042,0.7870151400566101,0.7833682894706726,0.7447273135185242,0.7897111177444458,0.7773869037628174
150576,Logan,2017-03-04,5,"'Logan' marks the final outing for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine\, a role he claimed as his own 17 years ago and now when people hear Wolverine they think of Hugh Jackman\, and when people hear Hugh Jackman they think of Wolverine. So for his last hurrah it is only fitting that he goes out with the most real\, gritty\, bloody\, violent\, and by far best Wolverine film to date. Set in 2029\, a world where Mutants are almost extinct\, Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) find themselves on the run tasked with the protection of a young mutant named Laura (Dafne Keen) who is being hunted down by an evil organisation. This movie is just incredible\, it transcends the superhero action genre in so many ways making itself known as a very grounded\, emotional\, and unique film in a genre packed with so many high concept CGI extravaganzas. Hugh Jackman is as good as he's ever been as Logan here and he gives it everything he's got with a powerful performance. The film has a lot of heart\, a lot of blood\, is visually beautiful and literally could not be done with anything less than an R rating (US). \n\nThe story chosen here for Wolverine's final appearance was perfect on so may levels. It deals with a very vulnerable Wolverine who is no longer the rage filled\, rapidly healing x-man we have come to know. And with that detail alone it opened up so many avenues for this film to explore themes and ideas no comic book movie has ventured to explore yet. The action here takes a back seat to some more subdued\, personal\, dramatic sequences that really for the first time explore Logan as a person. Learning how the current world has shaped him\, seeing his relationship with Professor X and Laura develop\, and watching him deal with his inner conflicts throughout the film made for so many thoughtful and engaging scenes that only upped the realism oozing from this film. But even though the action does take more of a back seat when compared to previous X-Men films\, when it goes down\, shit hits the fan.\n\nAnyone who says this story didn't need an R rating is lying to you because everything in this film including the emotion and understanding Logan's character relied greatly on the crazy amount of blood and gore flying across the screen. The R rating is not a gimmick\, it isn't just there to put the word out that this is a \""serious film\""\, it is there so that this story can be told and we can actually get Wolverine going full berserker rage mode on film for the first time. The action set pieces here are just as amazingly shot as the more scenic sequences and they are so damn gritty exciting to watch. No rapid cuts\, no shaky cam\, just very well choreographed\, brutal\, and fast paced close quarters action that is sure to blow your mind. And there is one sequence in the film i loved that is literally holding your breath intense that is filmed exquisitely\, but i won't spoil it here.\n\nHugh Jackman goes all in with his final appearance as Wolverine putting in a very strong\, emotional\, and real performance that grips you at so many moments throughout the film. He gives it his all and you can see just how much physical and emotional pain he is in at all times and it's just a testament to Jackman's incredible ability as an actor. Patrick Stewart is just as good as ever as Professor X\, he is a much older and inactive Professor in this film but he still plays his part very well. Newcomer Dafne Keen was great as Laura who can most certainly hold her own in action scenes and plays her character really convincingly. Boyd Holbrook was good in the villain role although he doesn't really get enough screen time to make much of an impact\, but who cares\, it isn't his story we want to see. \n\nSo in the end i absolutely loved Logan from beginning to end. The story builds gradually and flows through at a very calculated and even pace\, and it takes many turns making it a very fresh and unpredictable ride. If you are a fan of the previous X-Men films you will no doubt love what this movie has to offer\, but even if you aren't still check it out as it has such a different feel and aesthetic to the classic 'superhero film' that it should be recognised. But if blood and gore isn't your thing then still see the film anyway because it is too good to miss. \n\n9.1/10",True,0.9339948296546936,0.9351078867912292,0.9155425429344177,0.9451513290405273,0.941326916217804,0.9397330284118652,0.9081883430480957,0.9516115188598633,0.9386231899261475

150585,Logan,2017-03-20,5,"Logan\n\n[MAJOR  SPOILERS ]\n\nLogan works as a movie on many levels. As a drama\, it sets up one of the most intimate and poignant portraits of what it means to be a family. As an action movie\, it thrills and surprises with its visceral moments. As a comic book film\, it shows the true ferocity of one of the most popular Marvel heroes and is arguably one of the best of the genre (and in my opinion THE BEST WOLVERINE MOVIE).\n\nWhile most superhero movies deal with feats of glory or overcoming apocalyptic menaces\, LOGAN's heart lies in its characters. The dynamic between Professor X and Logan is not so much as mentor to student as it was in the past\, but it's now become an ailing\, mentally declining old man being watched over by a tired\, bitter and frustrated caregiver. While most X-Men movies prior showed a mutual respect for one another\, this movie rejects that premise and sets up the two aged and deteriorating mutants (physically with Logan\, mentally with Charles) for a love/hate friendship. Where previously he was portrayed as a strong and confident leader\, Charles is a man that is losing his mind to age and in the process is losing his ability to control his powers. Logan is one of the few mutants left that can assist him. However\, his body no longer heals like it once does as his adamantium skeleton has been slowly killing him.\n\nAt the same time we see Logan and Laura almost as an absentee father/daughter dynamic. Laura is the ward Logan reluctantly protects as she seeks to reunite with her own \""siblings\"". However\, several times when Logan is offered the chance to do what is right even when it's well in his power to do so\, he spurns the opportunity. He is a man that has been defeated and jaded. Logan just wants to be left alone. Ulimately\, it takes the death of Laura's old caregiver along with the multiple murders of the family the trio helps on the road and the threat of The Reavers closing in on the New Mutant children for him to finally realize his true calling as a hero and find his redemption.\n\nLogan also delivers as an action movie. Through nine films\, most viewers only received a taste of Wolverine's berserker rage. Because of its R-rating\, you see it in all its bloody glory. Limbs fly\, bodies are shredded\, and heads are speared and rolled. One of the movies best \""fight\"" scenes involves Professor X\, Logan\, and a casino hotel room where the concept of a fast-paced action sequence is reversed to snail-paced but suspenseful effectiveness. The battles between Logan and his clone were also some of the most exciting and brutal of any Marvel film. Laura (played with amazing deftness by Dafne Keen) had her moments to shine as the feral young mutant X-23 and will make a superb New Mutant. \n\nAs a comic book movie\, this is by far Jackman's and Wolverine's BEST film. As both Jackman and Patrick Stewart have said this will be their last as X-Men\, it sends off both the actors and their characters with the deepest reverence. Their tragic deaths protecting and saving the ones they loved are a fitting tribute to over 15 movie years in the life of the most iconic mutant heroes in the Marvelverse. \n\nPROS: Great story\, great action. THIS was what Wolverine should have been from the start - brutal\, unforgiving\, and vicious. A fitting end to Jackman's turn as Wolverine and Stewart's as Professor X.\n\nCONS: Interesting fact-  the original villain was planned to be Liev Schreiber's Sabertooth from the first Wolverine. It should have been him\, but the clone was definitely a literal metaphor for Wolverine facing his rage and inner demons.

150603,Logan,2017-03-09,5,"Logan Review:\n\nA chapter ends. And a new age of super hero movies is upon us. \nHugh Jackman has played ol'wolvie for over 17 years now. A character he has had to restrain to keep him PG enough for younger viewers. It's charming. It's cute. And it's absolutely not why I fell in love with the character. \nLogan is his unshackling.\n Based off a popular comic story about old wolverine near the end of his days. Logan does not follow the Marvel route. It does not exactly follow the comics. It doesn't make wise cracks out of no where. It takes the Christopher Nolan approach. It adapts the material to tell a new\, grounded story. \nI've seen it described elsewhere\, but raw is a very apt description of this movie. From how unflinching it is in showing life has beaten and broken down our weary hero\, just as much as it loves to show that his claws relish in playing a divorce attorney between bodies and limbs. And there is a lot. \nLogan while delivering a spectacle never forgets to remind you just how tired and fed up our heroes are.  Through pains in their eyes\, to outbursts of sorrow. It always makes you acutely aware of how our characters are feeling and how uncomfortable and exhausted they are with their situation. \nAnd it does it with such grace. \nWhere some movies like Batman vs Superman use darkness as more of an image filter\, Logan lives and breathes it. It's a fantastically unsettling world. \nThe action\, while maliciously wonderful in its brutality\, never were for mere actions sake but instead worked for the story. A dark and melancholy super hero movie that takes itself seriously. And you take it seriously with no question.\nHugh Jackman when he first appeared on screen back in 2000 set the standard for the fun spandex clad super hero. Young and free. Today as he retires the claws. He leaves a different legacy. He has grown up. He has matured. And in so doing. Shown the world that comic book movies are no longer just for summer fun. They\, like him have grown up. They've put away their one liners and they've put away their CGI toys. \n\nThe age of the serious comic book drama film has begun. \n\nI look forward to seeing Jackman's Oscar nomination in 2018 for Logan.  \nHe bloody well deserves it.",True,0.7099336385726929,0.6730319857597351,0.676480770111084,0.7024965882301331,0.6872705221176147,0.7060783505439758,0.7010979652404785,0.7044188976287842,0.6947393417358398

150612,Logan,2017-03-03,3,"Logan's first mode of action is taking down several immigrants attempting to steal one of his hubcaps. Then he receives a request from an unknown Mexican woman\, demanding he escorts a little silent girl named Laura to North Dakota. His motivation for this is low\, until three motivations erupt. One\, he watches an upsetting video of mutant children in hospitals forcefully trained to become soldiers as if in a concentration camp. Two\, she is one of these mutant children. Three\, she is his daughter. So now with her on the road with him as well as Professor X\, Logan learns his responsibility to punish those who neglect the gifts of these mutants.\n\nWhile the overall look of this journey looks nice\, cinematographer John Mathieson (Gladiator) constantly sets up horrible lighting arrangements that make the backgrounds lighter than the subject's face. It becomes especially problematic\, I might add\, when he films the action scenes super up close\, with nothing but a forgettable musical score to back it up. This is not the only thing that hurts the tension of the action scenes\, but the aftereffects of the turmoil are weak\, with no thanks to the unconvincing makeup effects. If you don't believe me\, look at the albino man who serves as Logan and Professor X's personal assistant: The pale texture of his skin looks plastered on from at most ten minutes in the makeup chair.\n\nAt least that's a minor complaint. Compare that to the stellar performances by Dafne Keen and Patrick Stewart\, and this may just as well be the greatest achievement based off a Marvel comic. Stewart in particular steals the show with his aged\, frail curtain call of a presence that just disorients your expectations further whenever he gets a seizure.\n\nWith such a humble grandfather figure here to ground us into the foundation of this world\, it's too bad that there's nothing else in the backdrop to give us a sense of Mexico's and Texas' true culture. The latest Academy Award nominee Hell or High Water delved quite a bit into this culture\, but the closest that Logan gets to in creating the social pressures is a brief moment in a casino\, and a villain with a really bad accent. Nothing else about the look of this world looks authentic enough to buy into.\n\nThe other moral implications are also quite problematic. We all can understand that bloody adult-rated violence can lead to viewers imitating it in real life\, but judging by the character of Logan as a father\, he takes several actions that make me question whether he's worth looking up to as a role model. Shortly after he brings in his daughter to escort her\, she robs from a convenience store (since she grew up in a hospital and thus doesn't know any better).

He is played by Hugh Jackman\, and is now an old\, disgruntled\, alcoholic. He spends his days caring for Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) in an abandoned smelting plant on the Mexican boarder\, along with Caliban (Stephen Merchant)\, who\, like the rest of these characters\, is a mutant\, someone who possesses superhuman abilities.\nOne day\, a Mexican woman comes to Logan for help\, asking him to escort an 11-year-old girl\, Laura (Dafne Keene)\, to a sort of mutant safe haven\, Eden\, in North Dakota. Logan is very reluctant of course\, but with some coaxing from Professor X and some other external threats\, he grudgingly agrees. From there\, it develops into a cross-country road trip film\, and all of the actors deliver terrific performances. \nWhat I cannot give enough praise to is the film's tone. It is set from the very first scene in the film\, and is bleak and encompassing. The film also has somewhat of a Western feel\, complete with gorgeous visuals\, which I really liked too. The combination of tone and visuals create a visceral that will not soon be forgotten; they are etched into the geography of my imagination like the South from The Color Purple.\nThe movie is well-paced\, building climatically to its ending where Logan\, who is very clearly dying throughout this film\, must give it all to save the kids. The film is mercilessly bleak and depressing so that we may truly feel happy and excited when Logan comes to the rescue to save the kids in a scene that's all the more upbeat as the result of it's grand\, encompassing shots of the natural wonders of North Dakota. \nThere is something that I do take issue with\, though. And it's too bad\, because this is really a four-star movie that I must knock a star from on account of this problem. It's the relationship between Laura and Logan. They hate each other basically the entire film. He doesn't want to have to take care of a little kid\, and borders on being physically abusive towards her\, and she clearly resents him for that. But then we get a very emotional ending that ends up coming off as cheesy because the movie refuses to develop their relationships. It never even hints at the idea that these characters could have any feelings but contempt towards each other\, and presents an emotional ending without ever having earned it. \nI have tried to get past this problem\, but I can't. This is not simply a critical nitpick; this is something that truly held the film back from all that it could be. I realized watching the ending that I was curiously unemotional\, and then trying to determine why I realized it was a direct result of their character development. Obviously developing them too quickly would be corny and unbelievable\, but as a result of not even having a subtle relationship\, the scene that attempted to be poignant and moving came off as being just as corny and unbelievable.    \nI can praise its bleak\, encompassing tone\, gorgeous visuals\, and Western feel\, but the character development doesn't work for me\, unfortunately. If they could have made it work\, if they could have made it for genuine and believable\, and additionally pushed their poignant ending even further\, this would have been a great movie. However\, they do not\, and I can't help but think it as a missed opportunity. \nUltimately\, though\, I enjoyed the film. The tone was mercilessly dark\, bleak\, and dystopian\, and that alone had enough power to draw the audience in. Like I said\, all of the characters were well fleshed-out and well acted\, even if the relationship between Logan and Laura didn't pay off the way it should have for me. This is still a very good comic book movie.\n\n--\nRating: 3/4",True,0.41955259442329407,0.34425464272499084,0.31872814893722534,0.3406835198402405,0.4065800905227661,0.41832420229911804,0.32252582907676697,0.41558656096458435,0.3098548352718353

150669,Logan,2017-03-10,4,"\""Logan\"" was decent. First half was better than the second half. Can't really go into what my major problems were with it without going into spoiler territory\, but let me just say that they repeated a mistake that they made in the third film in the poor way they treated a certain element of the series. Kind of baffles me\, to be honest.\nPros: Best film representation of the Wolverine character by far. The R rating was necessary to show what a bloodbath his world really would be were he real. Glad they didn't pull punches\, there.\nThe setting and pacing of the film was also perfect. Wilderness and uncertainty best suit this subject matter. The silly X doors and spandex suits of the typical films are gone; replaced by a gritty realism that heightens the tension.\nIt actually ends. No \""next time on X-Men\"" after credits scene; no inappropriate sense of tying up every single loose end to satisfy the unsatisfiable fan boys; just an ending to a film that carries real weight and a sense of finality. It doesn't linger\, and it doesn't tease. It just sends Hugh Jackman's portrayal of this character off in earnest. And on the whole\, it was satisfying.\nCons: That aforementioned poor handling of a certain element of the series I can't risk spoiling.\nThe supporting cast was actually pretty bad. The main villain is a caricature; the informant character that gives the backstory is one dimensional and convenient\, and the little girl running around shrieking all the time was annoying as hell to me. But the movie clearly thinks she's brilliant\, so there is far too much of her.\nIt's a fine film. It's certainly the best X-Men film.

152847,Logan,2018-06-25,4,"Making the most out of a Hard-R rating and a career-best lead performance\, this violent but thought-provoking kitty definitely has claws when it comes to closing out the most popular X-Man's run with a blockbusting but altogether satisfying bang. In this R-rated future-set actioner\, a weary Logan (Hugh Jackman) cares for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart)\, but their attempts to hide from the world and their legacies get upended when a young mutant arrives (Dafne Keen)\, pursued by dark forces.\n\nFrom the opening scene\, this very loose adaptation of the \""Old Man Logan\"" storyline from the Wolverine comic series doesn't shy away from body counts or subverting superhero movie tropes. In fact\, in this world-weary future\, the only recognizable things are Logan and Professor Charles Xavier. With Logan\, the X-Men franchise and its extensions have jumped ahead many years without fully explaining the Hows and Whys. Not connecting these dots proves far more intriguing as it gives the tone and setting a nebulousness akin to a certain classic trilogy of Spaghetti westerns where the main character has no name. Set in a really down and dirty time for mutants\, itself very western-esque\, both of these characters are very blue in two very different manners--emotionally and filthily. This is to say\, it's a downbeat landscape in which most of mutantkind has been wiped out and this depression manifests itself in the form of many F-Bombs and obscene shouting matches. While working 'blue' would seem to fit Logan's curmudgeonly persona like a glove\, moviegoers will be surprised how well it suits the typically do-gooding Prof. X as well. What results is a road movie that allows each character to show a decent amount of heart as these two aging meta-humans undergo a lot of human changes. Oh\, there are blood\, guts\, and set pieces aplenty but this is the most adult extension of the X-franchise for other reasons. Indeed\, even set in a latter-day dystopia\, this is the most grounded of X-Men outings because our heroes ultimately face off with their own mortality. At times head-turning and heart-wrenching in the same scene\, this swan song goes for broke in all of the best ways.\n\nMind you\, Logan won't win awards for its dialogue (as much as the story isn't typical\, the lines are oftentimes downright pedestrian) but it's still a comic book movie at heart and comic book movies aren't striving for David Mamet diction to sell through the plot. And what a plot it is. The fact that writer-director James Mangold (who shares screenwriting credit with Scott Frank and Michael Green) even positioned this as the final go-round for fan favorite Wolverine - or that Fox greenlit it - amounts to shear bravery (what was borrowed and built upon from the comic book alone deserves plaudits). Just listen to the summary: A graying and wrinkled Agent X drops F-Bombs and aggressors while navigating a very pessimistic western landscape with his old boss and a young girl who just might be the world's most powerful mutant. Such a bold move sounds more like stupidity as opposed to bravery but the end result is brilliantly executed. Hugh Jackman has played this role 8 times before but here\, he is free to color outside of the lines. Lived-in at this point\, he stretches Logan's skin to a ridiculously nuanced degree--never to the point of feeling false though. Likewise\, Patrick Stewart gives a supporting turn that breaks the heart but also feels quite appropriate. Heath Ledger received an Oscar posthumously for his performance as the Joker\, proving that comic book characters are worthy of H'Wood gold. Jackman and Stewart very much earn their tears as well. \n\nTo Sum It All Up: Truth and Claw",True,0.4823848307132721,0.43254968523979187,0.3959866464138031,0.4670450985431671,0.353893905878067,0.46517089009284973,0.35793745517730713,0.4860793650150299,0.5269334316253662

152890,Logan,2017-03-20,4,"Mangold  was never on my radar as an outstanding director. Yet when you look him up you find he directed audience favourites like \""Walk the Line\"" and \""Girl\, Interrupted\"". This is a audience respecting director who seems to relish his Hollywood invisibility. He may not be an Oliver Stone or Milos Forman\, but holds up the Hollywood torch for putting the star in the forefront. Speaking of Oliver Stone\, the violence in Logan is the most Senecan that has been seen to date. If you like watching live fights like boxing or EFC\, Mangold makes you feel every punch\, slash\, and stab. And the character arcs from Wolverine to Professor X to the reticent girl Laura all develop with color and nuance. There are character twists\, plot twists\, and\, as mentioned\, plot pushing body mangalations\, that keep the story moving scene to scene. Not having known Mangold directed the film before watching it\, with all the Hispanic notes in the story\, my first impression that it was directed by a Mexican\, South American or possibly a European director. Considering Mangold had first studied film under the wing of Alexander Mackendrick\, he seems to have learned to perfect the late mentor's quote\, \""...film begins between the ears and under the hair of one character\, and ends between the ears and under the scalpel of the audience.\"" (Wikipedia) Logan is a visceral film. It is not an action film by box office standards. It is a drama\, horror film\, comedy\, science fiction\, buddy film--all in earnest. It might be fair to say it is Mangold's most human story to date--a somber yet captivating movie.\nHumanity aside\, the film does lack in its attempt of a villain with depth. Will anyone create a good bad guy? Apocalypse from the not-too-long-ago \""X-man: Apocalypse\"" captured a sense of mystery about him (though not original). In Logan we first meet the top henchman Pierce (portrayed by Boyd Holbrook) but his boyish good looks never convinced me as a threat. The arch villian is the stock character of the mad scientist-- which I admit is starting to get tiresome. Grant\, playing Dr. Rice\, does a fine job\, and though the writers made clear his motivation they forgot to develop his humanity. There is a touch Frankenstein in him when he wants to control his Clone Wolverine. But I would have liked him to treat him more like a son so when the clone is defeated the first time\, we sympathize with a father's suffering. What do you think?\nIf you've ever secretly wished to see superheroes get killed\, here is your chance.

While not quite as outstanding as that DC masterpiece\, 'Logan' is still a bold\, satisfying coda to Hugh Jackman's beloved potrayal as Wolverine; this is a very dark\, gritty story that takes our character into really unsettling places. But with all its bleakness\, the picture is rather beautiful and very human; evoking a strong message of hope & humanity while holding everything together with amazingly brutal action scenes\, Jackman's rawest turn yet and an incredible debut for newcomer Dafne Keen! - 9/10 (A-)",True,0.3464704751968384,0.04104871675372124,0.008921544067561626,0.11290537565946579,0.025333620607852936,0.457988440990448,0.08327154815196991,0.18758265674114227,0.270762175321579
152988,Logan,2017-03-10,3,"March 3\, 2017\n\n\""Logan\"" sets out to be the black sheep of the \""X-Men\"" franchise by being the first entry in the series to be rated R. And it's a hard R. This is an unabashedly violent\, gruesome\, raw and sometimes hard-to-watch action movie; it creates a world that's dark\, dusty and inhabited by misanthropic characters who possess a bleak and hopeless outlook on life. It's not unlike (and probably drew inspiration from) \""Mad Max: Fury Road\"" with regards to its tone\, locations and depraved people. \n\nBut then\, the \""X-Men\"" movies have never really been \""upbeat.\"" The humor and playfulness found in other superhero movies like\, say\, \""Spider-Man\,\"" \""The Avengers\"" or \""Deadpool\"" was never really a staple quality for the X-Men\, probably because these superheroes always felt especially marginalized; they're lonely\, sad\, fearful and angry\, and \""Logan\"" takes these qualities to the extreme.\n\nHowever\, it would be wrong to praise \""Logan\"" just because it's dark\, violent and disturbing. Being these things for their own sake doesn't really accomplish anything if there isn't a worthwhile story being told\, and indeed James Mangold's film often feels redundant with its brutality\, almost as if its carnage is the story. How many times\, for instance\, do we have to see the bad guys decapitated or viscously stabbed through various parts of the body before we become desensitized to such imagery and it no longer carries any meaning? \""Logan\"" reaches that limit by its end and the movie is ultimately longer than it needs to be\, no doubt because of its excessive action sequences. So on the whole\, it's far from perfect.\n\nOn the other hand\, the movie is often bold\, exciting\, well-performed and technically impressive. Mangold and his team have crafted a visually stirring action drama that sees its titular character finally come to terms with himself\, and even though the plot\, characters and atmosphere feel derivative of other dystopian movies that have come before it\, collectively\, they keep us engaged and get a rise out of us.\n\nBesides its bloodshed\, another way \""Logan\"" sets itself apart is by more or less operating independently of its brethren. Yes\, there are references to the other \""X-Men\"" movies\, particularly \""Days of Future Past\,\"" but because this one is more character-driven\, we feel it tells us everything we need to know and therefore it's not imperative viewers have seen the original or other sequels in order to know what's happening here. This allows \""Logan\"" to stand on its own and we simply follow it's story about a troubled soul who's never been able to shake his turbulent past or find genuine purpose in life. And now\, Logan (Hugh Jackman)\, a.k.a. Wolverine\, wants nothing more than to buy a boat\, sail away and die. He assumes it's just the same\, since the mutant population is all but extinct because of a virus. His body is already giving way-the adamantium metal that runs throughout his body\, which gives him those extendable claws he's famous for\, is now killing him and overriding his innate mutant ability to heal instantaneously.\n\nHe and another mutant named Caliban (Stephen Merchant)\, an albino with the ability to track other mutants\, essentially squat in an abandoned plant near the Texas-Mexico border. They take turns caring for the ailing Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)\, who has a neurodegenerative disease and unless he gets routine shots of a certain serum\, he has a seizure and his brain sends out powerful waves that cause a paralyzing\, pulsating environment for anyone in the immediate area. Logan knows this and works as a chauffeur\, trying to enough funds to buy his boat and take himself and Xavier out to the middle of the ocean. In the meantime\, he'll work\, drink\, smoke cigars and pretend not to care for others even though he does.\n\nBut Logan's plans to lay low get disrupted when he's approached by two different individuals with connected but very different agendas. The first is the obviously sinister Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook)\, a security agent for Transigen\, the company responsible for destroying mutants out of fear they couldn't be controlled. In the time since the Westchester incident of \""Days of Future Past\"" (it is now 2029)\, Transigen has overseen two different projects in which they've tried to breed their own mutants using preserved mutant DNA\, including Logan's\, all in an effort to turn them into weapons. The first project\, \""X-23\,\"" failed and the company found the child mutants it fostered had too many defects. \n\nWith the advent of \""X-24\,\"" Pierce\, who comes equipped with one of those bad guy mechanical claws\, is rounding up all the \""X-23\"" children in order to dispose of them. This is where the second individual who approaches Logan comes into play. Her name is Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez)\, a former nurse at Transigen. She now watches after a young \""X-23\"" mutant named Laura\, played with focused intensity by Dafne Keen and who was been bred with Logan's DNA. Needless to say\, she also has metal claws and has been genetically engineered to run\, jump\, flip and strike like a super solider and the movie isn't shy about showing off her abilities or willingness to kill anyone she deems a threat\, which is many.\n\nGabriela beseeches Logan to take Laura north to a place called \""Eden\,\"" the supposed sanctuary for the remaining \""X-23\"" kids. Though he initially refuses\, run-ins with Pierce and an uncovering of Transigen's dirty laundry force Logan to take action. Several bodies later\, he\, Professor Xavier and Laura are on a road trip from Texas to North Dakota\, and so their survival adventure begins. \n\nThe screenplay by Mangold\, Scott Frank and Michael Green uses the characters' journey as a platform for all the customary action sequences\, but also quieter\, more human\, er\, mutant\, scenes. The best of each actually involves Xavier\, who at one point goes too long without taking his serum and thus causes the crippling\, vibratory effect I mentioned earlier. The scene happens in a hotel and it's a masterful example of timing and special effects. A more down-to-earth moment takes place when Logan\, Xavier and Laura spend the night at farm family's house after helping them round up their horses. During it\, Xavier makes a heartfelt confession and we feel the kind of emotion the movie is trying to convey. \n\nDespite these scenes\, though\, at the end of the day\, \""Logan\"" is still a superhero movie and\, as such\, adheres to a tried-and-true formula that allows us to guess where it's going. And just because it's exorbitantly violent and gory doesn't mean it's any more admirable than if it wasn't; it just means it more exclusive to adults. \n\nStill\, the characters and their plight resonate with us and the relationship that develops between Logan and Laura carries weight. Jackman and Keen take their roles seriously and we empathize with them as they struggle to find peace\, and even though it ends on a hopeful note\, Mangold\, to his credit\, never make this world out to be one we envy. Watching it is like experiencing a war zone\, and perhaps Mangold's intention with the R-rating was to incorporate enough extreme violence in order to attack violence in general by showing just how unpleasant it can be. \n\nIs that stretching it? Maybe\, but whatever the case\, \""Logan\,\"" as a movie\, hovers between standard and effectively dark. It's not groundbreaking by any means and we've seen other\, better movies like it\, but for those who've stuck with Logan throughout the 10 \""X-Men\"" films in which he's appeared (if only for a few seconds)\, this last one makes us feel like the character has finally come full circle. And for those who haven't\, the film is still visually stimulating and emotional-not to the degree that it's violent\, but high enough to be satisfying.",True,0.8297915458679199,0.8341798782348633,0.7971999645233154,0.8350992798805237,0.8307661414146423,0.8096577525138855,0.7957153916358948,0.8384420871734619,0.8332610726356506

154362,Logan,2017-12-09,5,"Most of us are finally vindicated on the times parents and teachers and told us that comic books worthless and would rot our minds. They hid them under our beds\, in basements and treehouses\, anywhere adults would hopefully not search. Currently\, the two most successful and lucrative will be franchises are derived from comic books and then more adult successes\, graphic novels. Once again\, the rivalry between DC Comics and Marvel Comics is stronger than ever but this time the stakes are quite literally billions of dollars in box office and merchandising. For Marvel and I saw competing studios have divided up most of their most popular characters by mutually exclusive competitors. Disney Studios has acquired the bulk of the characters building the Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU 20th Century Fox has taken ownership of the X-Men. Without a doubt\, the most popular character in the X-Men universe is a mysterious loner named Logan better known by his nom de guerre\, Wolverine. Has been created on screen by the multitalented Hugh Jackman. He has portrayed the mutant curmudgeon nine times on screen more than any other actor or character. This film\, 'Logan'\, is his swansong with Mr. Jackman putting aside his adamantium claws and trademark cigar. It has been stated by those involved in the productions of this film that it is not intended to be fully contained within the Canon established by the X-Men franchise\, even though recent movies have reset the timeline. Critical reception and box office receipts have been uneven within the X-Men franchise year it was near universal agreement that this is one of the best films within the expansive catalog of movies. After a couple movies with a revised\, younger cast playing earlier versions of the established characters is only fitting that for this final appearance of Mr. Jackman as Wolverine should return to the seasoned cast that started it all. The filmmakers point of view Wolverine's regenerative powers have allowed Mr. Jackman to continue his character regardless of the era used as a setting without the time-consuming and expensive need for aging prosthetics.\n\nThe story opens in the year 2029\, dystopia for mutants. It has been over a quarter of a century since a new mutant has been born. Humans are now on the verge of extinction no longer able to threaten the continued viability of Homo sapiens. Logan is finally feeling the effects of his 197-year lifespan his regenerative powers failing and the adamantium-clad skeleton steadily poisoning him. Logan is now showing his age with graying hair and skin now revealing scars. A body that was once able to shake off bullets\, blades and explosions racked with pain. Now\, he cared for a frail and aged Xavier (Patrick Stewart)\, who is now prone to seizures losing control of his telepathic abilities unconsciously freezing people around him. Logan wants to raise enough money to purchase a boat and relocate to an isolated location we can live out his days in safety along with the last remnant of mutants. To help locate survivors is accompanied by a mutant with a very special ability\, Caliban (Stephen Merchant). This is an exceptionally interesting choice of casting. Mr. Merchant has established himself as a well-respected comedy writer and actor. This is part of a growing trend of comedians undertaking intensity dramatic roles. Alkali/Transide. Perception of the company as a leader in genome research for altering crops and\n\nGabriela Lopez (Elizabeth Rodriguez)\, is in the employ of the largest biotech conglomerate\, public perception is a leader in genetic research beneficial to humanity. This is a cover on enterprise devoted to recognizing various organisms. She approaches Logan with the offer of a job\, to escort and an 11-year-old girl\, Laura (Daphne Keen) to a safe refuge North Dakota\, despite his trepidation\, in need of money\, except the offer. The Very predictable point is used quite effectively to progress the story. Caliban is kidnapped by a group of mercenaries hired by the Corporation. Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and his Reavers\, a gang of outlaw cyborgs. They are assigned the task of bringing the girl back at all cost. On the heels of the success of 'Deadpool\,' this is the first film in the X-Men franchise to receive a MPAA R rating. One of the first signs that this story deals with significantly more mature themes than most fans is accustomed to usually points that have been previously such as prejudice\, ostracizing minorities and abuse of power are pivotal to this film but are taken to an intensity that is never seen before in this series of movies.\n\nLogan is the secret that services the dramatic motivator for the story. Or is one of the several mutant children that transgender was breeding them as part of the infamous X-23 program\, a successor to the project that covered Loan's skeleton with adamantium. The head of the project Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant) concluded that those research subjects\, those children\, were obsolete and ordered them euthanized. Not only is Laura the last of that group but the assignment takes a deeply personal turn when Logan discovers Laura was cloned from his DNA. The story does subject the audience to the use of a blatant plot contrivance\, just as the Reavers catch up with then in Oklahoma City\, it looks as those the situation was hopeless. With perfect timing\, Professor Xavier has a major seizure freezing the gang of hunters. This allows them to make a hasty escape. This twist is untenable an example of Deus ex machina but when the context is considered it is forgivable. It substantially expedites the flow of the story enabling the pacing to be maintained at a pace suitable for an action/thriller. This allows the script to remain focused on the most important aspect of the story\, the character development.\n\nThere is a highly effective economy to the elements necessary to continually provide momentum to the story. When Xavier has another seizure\, he is caught in a horrific memory of similar mental outburst back at the school in Westchester. The ensuing mayhem cost many lives including many X-Men. Xavier\, extremely weakened\, thinks he is confessing to Logan\, but we are introduced to the main antagonist\, X-24\, a feral byproduct of the experiments\, also cloned from Logan's DNA. This affords the opportunity of another plot convivence\, permitting Mr. Jackman to assume another role. This lays the foundation for one crucial subtext to the story\, Logan's perpetual struggle with his own inner unbridled animalistic nature. All paths created by the numerous story threads are readily pulled together in the climactic battle we all realized was inevitable yet thanks to the carefully crafted emotional content intrinsically infused in the story\, there is not a dry eye watching the dénouement of the story at hand and more importantly the amazing saga of the Wolverine.\n\nIt was unnatural to expect such extraordinary talents as Mr. Jackman and Sir Patrick to remained tied to a role for this long. True\, both of their respective characters are substantially multifaceted\, a result of excellent writing but mostly due to the astounding skill these consummate artists have in bringing a character to life. Jackman is a seasoned performer at home on stage or screen. His repertoire encompasses so much more than action hero with proficiency in musical theater. Of course\, it is no secret that Sir Patrick is a classically trained Shakspearian actor able to master any challenge. Daphne Keens truly the breakout star of the show who is completely able to stand toe to toe with a pair of the most accomplished performers currently working. For one so young it is a rare treat to watch her emulate the fierceness that Jackman has imbued in the character of Logan over the course of so many years. Rather than attempting an impression\, Ms. Keen incorporates the critical emotional and physiological manifestations of Logan reworking then\, molding them into a character that is original and completely a product of her burgeoning abilities. She is an actress destined to be a leader in the next generation of performers. It is always sad to see such a favorite character go but this films a fitting tribute to the character and the actor who brought him to life.",True,0.06482308357954025,0.0708390399813652,0.0645759105682373,0.062093980610370636,0.05487678200006485,0.06268133968114853,0.05984196439385414,0.06096312776207924,0.05291684716939926

155548,Logan,2017-03-17,5,"My review of Logan!\n\nLogan is the next entry in the long-running X-Men / Wolverine films. The basic synopsis of the film is this takes place in the near future they're only a few mutants left in the world. Some things happen and Logan has to take this girl Laura (X-23) to a place where she will be kept safe from the people chasing her and that might have other mutants.\n\nRight of the bat let me say this Logan is a masterpiece of a film. It's pretty close to perfect in my opinion. This is a true R-rated adult comic book movie. That's not because it's only ultraviolent. ( which it is very much super violent ) it's because it's very grounded and the movie is not afraid to give you long stretches with no violence or action and focus on character and story. The movie is very dark and somber. But it still leaves room for some levity some funny moments and some heartwarming ones. But the overall tone of the film is very dark and sad. \n\nBy far one of my favorite things about this film is Hugh Jackman's performance as Logan. He's always been great as the character. But in this movie they really gave him an opportunity to showcase how much of a great dramatic actor he is. Logan is old he's lived a very long time he seen a lot of stuff he's tired he's not The Wolverine he used to be. Very vulnerable now too which is interesting when you first see him in the movie he's getting his ass kicked for a little bit. He Is drinking a lot more than usual and he's doing a lot of illegal back alley things to get medicine for Professor X. Pretty much we are seeing Logan at his very low. And it is acted and portrayed perfectly by Hugh Jackman. You can see the pain in Logan's eyes. You can tell by the way he speaks and the thing he says that he is a broken person now. \n\nPatrick Stewart also does a very amazing job in this film. We're seeing a Professor X who isn't himself anymore and when you first see him it truly is heartbreaking. To see a man who has been an influence and a father figure to all these mutants who needed that\, so broken and week. The actress that plays Laura in the film is also very good. \n\nNow let's talk about the action scenes. The action scenes in this movie did not disappoint. They are ultraviolet and exhilarating. All the action scenes in the movie are filmed beautifully. You see the whole thing in it's beautiful gory\, limbs being sliced off glory. My favorite action set piece is a part where there in the woods near the end. That scene was total high octane\, heart pounding action greatness. I also found the way the movie ends very beautiful. \n\nThe first and the third act are the best in the film. The second act is still really good but it does kinda meander little bit and the pacing is a little off. But that didn't really ruin this movie experience for me. \n\nLogan is a dark\, deep and beautiful comic book film. An adult comic book film I have been waiting for since I first saw The Dark Knight. Logan is without a doubt a masterpiece and if this really is Hugh Jackman's last time as Wolverine he gave him an outstanding final film.\n\nI'm going to give Logan a 10 at 10!",True,0.5965294241905212,0.5584098696708679,0.5633629560470581,0.613239049911499,0.5934432744979858,0.6027780175209045,0.5834699273109436,0.6068651080131531,0.5976088643074036

155698,Logan,2017-03-17,4,"Nearly 17 years ago\, \""X-Men\"" debuted in theaters. While it wasn't the best reviewed movie ever by any stretch of the imagination\, it did show that the well-known Marvel comic book properties could earn solid box office numbers. Since then\, the likes of \""Spider-Man 2\""\, \""The Dark Knight\""\, and \""The Avengers\""  have evolved the genre from something of interest to only comic book fans to the general public.  We've had 3 Spider-Mans\, 2 Batmans\, 2 Supermans\, and 3 Hulks on the big screen. Despite all that change\, the X-Men universe has remained somewhat intact. Sure\, they've had cast changes but only to show younger versions of characters. Meanwhile\, the older cast still manages to pop-up occasionally. The closest thing to a reboot was merely a soft reboot that didn't involve any cast changes.\n\nA large part of this could be attributed to the brilliant casting of the first \""X-Men\"" film. Individually\, Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Ian McKellan's Magneto created the kind of spot-on portrayals a comic fan dreams of. But even they pale in comparison to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. The 6'3\"" Australian was a last minute replacement to play the 5\""3\"" Canadian character. To say he wasn't comic book accurate would be an understatement. But what he managed to do was improve on the comic book character by bringing it humanity while staying true to the original gruffness of its roots.\n\nHugh Jackman has played Wolverine in more movies than any other actor playing a superhero. Jackman has appeared as Wolverine in 9 movies and had a starring role in 7 of those. \""Logan\""\, by all accounts\, is his\, and likely Stewart's\, swan song to the X-Men universe. It's bittersweet in two ways: 1)  because it's sad to see these actors leave iconic roles that they've been at for so long\, and 2) because while it's a serviceable outro\, it's not nearly as strong as these characters/actors deserve.\n\nFurther\, this movie seems to ignore both \""X-Men Origins: Wolverine\"" and \""X-Men: Apocalypse\"" in the continuity. I will happily admit this movie is a fair bit better than those\, nevertheless\, it's important to follow the rules previously set up in the universe. Especially when within the post-credits scene in \""X-Men: Apocalypse\"" there was a teaser for Logan. To discover that this tease went nowhere was disappointing at best. Particularly since it indicated a classic X-Men villain would make an appearance\, when in reality the villains of this movie are essentially canon fodder to be shredded by Logan and company.  Eventually\, near the end of act 2\, a villain appears that could actually be a threat to the team.\n\nThe \""Logan\"" movie has a solid setup. It's the not too distant future (kudos to the makeup department for convincingly adding a couple of decades to Stewart and Jackman) and mutants are dying out. No new mutants has been born for 25 years and those that are left are seeing their powers diminish in various ways. As a swan song\, this is perfect. With most of the heroes gone and forgotten\, the heroes that remain have to prove they might still be able to do some good in the world.\n\nUnfortunately\, acts 2 and 3 become little more than a road trip movie with Logan\, Xavier\, and a young girl named Laura (played very well by Dafne Keen)\, as they travel from Mexico to North Dakota. There are various stops along the way that usually result in the group being discovered by the bad guys and having the slash their way out. Throughout the trip it's impossible for the audience to know how far they've gone. Have they gone 50\, 100\, 1000 miles?  As it is\, the audience has no way to judge if the journey is almost done or just beginning.\n\nI'm not sure this movie intends to have a moral\, but if it did it almost certainly would be\, \""no good deed goes unpunished\"". Of course\, it might also be \""no bad deed goes unpunished\"". Perhaps\, the moral is simply \""no deed goes unpunished\"". It does seem as though Wolverine could've prevented a lot of death by simply minding his own business. It honestly gets to the point where death is so prevalent in this movie\, it makes it very hard to develop an attachment to any character. Why would the audience become invested in characters when the movie is obviously willing to kill anyone at anytime?\n\nHowever\, even though this movie was a disappointment\, I can't be too harsh on it. If nothing else\, seeing Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in these roles one last time is worth the price of admission. These are two actors who I doubt could give a bad performance if they tried. The story\, even with it's failings\, is strong enough not to diminish their performances. Additionally\, James Mangold's direction is solid enough although the pacing of the movie can get fairly muddy in act 2.\n\nI probably could've been more forgiving of the errors within the movie if they had given some thought to developing the relationship between Wolverine and Laura.  What should have been the beating heart of this movie is all but overlooked. Still\, as far as outros go\, this is a solid one. Further\, it's great to see Wolverine exit in an explosion of gore that a character with claws would almost certainly manage.\n\nIt's sad to see an end to this chapter in comic book movies\, but\, on the other hand\, we still have Deadpool.",True,0.537206768989563,0.5274543762207031,0.5170257687568665,0.5401661396026611,0.5334284901618958,0.5349816083908081,0.5158870816230774,0.538834273815155,0.5223446488380432

158596,Logan,2017-03-22,5,"Now I may be a humongous Marvel nerd\, but I am by no means a Wolverine fan.\n\nI always found his character to be overrated and the mainstream's love of him is a big reason why I never was a big fan of the X-Men movies. (That and the fact that most of them weren't all that good if we're being honest) But with that being said...\n\nFrom the moment I saw the first trailer\, I knew that this movie was going to be different and I put this film on my radar. But when I saw the second trailer I started fangirling so hard! Once I saw that the little girl would be X-23 I started doing backflips. She is was one of the most overlooked characters in the Marvel Universe and it is was a crying shame because of how impressive her backstory is. This film gave her fair justice.\n\nHer origin was a bit darker in the comics and she went through so much more than what the film showed but I was more than satisfied with the changes that they made because the changes did something that I have NEVER previously seen in a Super Hero film until now. The changes made all of our heroes seem...vulnerable.\n\nWolverine's healing factor is weakened due to the Adamantium in his bones poisoning him. Charles Xavier is suffering from some sort of mental illness which is quite a horrific combination considering that he has the most deadly mind in the world. And last but certainly not least\, they made Laura. X-23. a little younger and less experienced than she was in the comics. In X-23's file that Logan was looking at\, it read that she was 132 months (My mathulator says 132/12=11yrs old same age as Dafne Keen at the time of it was filmed) old while in the comics\, X-23 was actually 13 years old and already had done many assassinations for her employers. Including some high profile ones to assassinate druglords and politicians!\n\nBut anyway I'm getting off topic. The point of that blurb being\, every hero in this film was not at their fullest strength and it added some much-needed suspense into the superhero genre. And speaking of suspense\, holy hell was there a lot! I couldn't believe how dark and gritty that this film was. Once Will Munson's family was slaughtered by Donald Pierce's cloned Wolverine shortly followed by Charles Xavier\, I knew that anything was possible and for the first time that I've ever watched a superhero film\, I genuinely feared for Wolverine's life and then of course for X-23.\n\nAs awesome as Hugh Jackman was\, it's Dafne Keen who steals the show here. And she didn't need much dialogue to do it either. First of all\, she is super adorable! But what was even more impressive was her gymnastic abilities. I never thought I'd ever say this but\, an 11 yeard old girl was bad ass! Never in my life have I used those two adjectives together to descirbe one person. Check out this article on Dafne Keen:What You Don't Know About Laura From Logan. (http://www.looper.com/47924/dont-know-laura-logan/) Sounds like she's going to be an actress we'll be hearing about for a long time. Really really hoping that we'll be seeing her in future X-Men installments. Anyone else think that she should be in the running for at the very least\, \""Best Supporting Actress\"" for the 2017 Oscars?\n\nThe action was intense\, the story was fantastic\, and this was by far the most emotional superhero film that I've ever seen! I was stunned when they chose to let Wolverine die. But I wasn't really upset as I knew it was going to be Hugh Jackman's last film. So I was sitting there eyes wide in surprise taking everything it all in feeling fine... until X-23 started crying and saying \""Daddy!\"" And then Logan replied\, \""So this is what it feels like.\"" Damn it! Who's chopping onions in here? I didn't cry\, but I was super close.\n\nThis is not only the best X-Men related movie\, but one of the best of the superhero genre.

158975,Logan,2017-03-04,4,"Okay\, So I just finished watching the movie Logan\, and im a couple of tumblers of whiskey and a glass of wine (In progress) deep so I thought id shamelessly share my thoughts with all of you my loyal readers....WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nLOGAN.\n\nAlternative titles - Daddy Daughter murder fest. \nProfessor X escapes the nursing home\nEat this not that.\n\n\nSet it a dystopian 2029\, Logan starts with the former Wolverine (Logan Tom being his government name) living somewhere south of the border and working as basically an Uber XL driver. Hes clearly addicted too booze. Living some sort of very bitter life. The X-men are gone\, all his friends are dead and hes trying to live a quiet life. Now Wolverine is famous for his healing powers and while Logan has these its clear that hes loosing them\, something that seems like cancer (and we later find out what it is) is poisoning his body. And basically hes slowly losing his healing powers\, though still has them log enough in this movi to chope off 2 heads\, 4 arms\, and 5 legs by my count. \n\nMeanwhile Professor X is the victim of a degenerative brain disease\, something like alzhiemers or dementia which leaves him with these terrible seizures that can freeze and kill all regular people around him. His Brain has been classified a weapon of mass destruction by the HSA. (\""So has my cock!\"" shouts some frat boys sitting in the back of the movie theatre\, high fives all around).  Professor X has essentially an Albino Nurse who gets bitched around by wolverine the whole movie and we later learn has the power to identify. Where mutants are.\n\nThen theres Wolverine's Daughter\, though its unclear if she is realyl his daughter... we'll have to ask maury povich about that. The girl who is mute for the first half of the movie and then surprise speaks both spanish and english! despite never being in school and living in mexico her entire life. Shes basically the girl version of wolverine\, with al lthe rage of a five year old girl (i thought they were supposed to be sweet at this age) and id say double the kiling power. By the end of the movie your left to wonder\, if shes this pissed off at 5\, and with the obvious daddy issues shes going to have\, is she going to turn into some sort of muderous stripper pornstar in 10 years. Did I just come up with the Porn-Spin off of this movie? You heard it hear first. \n\nThere are probably 2-3 key points I want to touch on in this movie.\n\nFirst\n\nLogan's emotional development or lack their off. Now if you follow these wolverine/ xmen movies you know Logan Tom- the Wolverine has been alive since around/before the civil war. Which means in a standard sense hes roughly 180 years old by 2029. ( I had to google when was the civil war to figure this out). On top of that if you take in the alternate X-Men days of future past timeline where he goes back to the 1970s from a distypoian letss say 2018 you can add an extra 40-50- years to his age. So Logan Tom is roughly 250 years old. And yet he still deals with his emotions\, chiefly anger\, by : Taking a shovel to his own getaway car\, screaming in rage at the air\, drinking heavily\, ignoring and abusing the ones he loves\, and of course going on murderous rampages. You think somewhere in those 250 years hed have experienced some personal growth. Maybe settled down\, started a family\, lived a quiet life. But clearly this man is clawed as well as flawed. Maybe thats what makes him a likeable anti-hero. Still I found it funny to watch him deal with anger in the way a 10 year old throwing a tantrum would.\n\nLogan's Daughter Laura and Logan's relationship.\nLogan was a master class in parenting. How to teach your child good table manners\, how to prevent her from massequring the pay booth at one of those kids rides outside of gastatations\, and how to prevent her from killing random people who dont give her things she wants. But  this movie also serves as a grave warning to the perils of sperm banking. Now im assuming Logan didnt squirt one out to make an extra 10 bucks some tim eback in ought 6 (thats 1906) \, but the premise of Laura's existance is that she was made in the lab using a mexican surrogate mother and Wolverine's DNA. I'd say this is a pretty stark warning out there to all those college guys looking to make a few quick bucks to buy a round of 2 dollar jimbeans on tuesday night at their local college bar.\n\n\nthe Food industry Conspiracy underlying the entire movie.\n\nThis is a little more subtle and you really have to listen to the movie at certain parts to get it. The idea seems to me that the entire race of mutants were wiped out by poisoning the food. Well not poisoning but using a mix of mad science and high fructose corn syrup. Maybe if the Jubilee\, Gambit\, Psylock\, Magneto\, Rogue\, Beast and Co and all adhered to the same gluten free\, GMO free\, Vegan\, locally grown and produced Organic diet as Wolverine and Professor X they would not have lost their powers and been wiped off the face of the earth. This did make me look down at my popcorn\, sour patch kids and coke and wonder if I once had super powers. Damnit. Im not sure which power i'd take. Teleportation or Time Travel. Its a close one.\n\nOverall good movie\, worth a watch\, good action but not too much\, some emotional scenes that worked some that fell flat. \n\nOne liner: Violent comic book action movie meets Father- Daughter family comedy.",True,0.23893585801124573,0.24361002445220947,0.1859910488128662,0.20877598226070404,0.16233240067958832,0.21101169288158417,0.19998446106910706,0.20434032380580902,0.24014164507389069

163524,Logan,2017-03-04,5,"Proper Perspective: The story of three generations coming together\, learning from each other\, and going on a journey of reflection set in a futuristic western world. Oh\, and it is based on a comic book character...\n\nZero-Zip-Nada Spoilers. None-zo.\n\nOfficial Synopsis: In the near future\, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives\, being pursued by dark forces.\n\nPlot: Not too far into the future\, most mutants are dead or gone and Logan (Hugh Jackman)\, Professor Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart)\, and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) are trying to live their lives off the radar. That is interrupted when a nurse named Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez) and young girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) enter their lives needing help from Logan. With Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and Dr. Rice (Richard E. Grant) lead the charge to capture Laura ad continue their efforts to eliminate the mutant race\, while also trying to perfect it.\n\nTake: This is\, in my opinion\, the best single performance by an actor in a \""comic book movie\"" to date by Hugh Jackman rivaling what Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight. He was that good in this movie. I waited to write this until after seeing Logan twice (which is something I strongly suggest as a general rule before reviewing any movie) and through that lens\, really appreciated the nuance of this movie. \n\nI mentioned Jackman's performance\, but there everyone all around in this movie really brought their A-Game. Sir Patrick Stewart gave arguably his best turn as Professor X after seven previous movies of embodying this character\, he shined in a way that was both brilliant and unique to the previous movies. As the main screen villain\, Holbrook went from a guy in a few movies to a star. He was fantastic in this movie as the smart\, well spoken\, almost fanboy baddie that truly believed what he was doing was right and that Logan and company were in actuality\, the real villains. \n\nAgain\, the performances were flawless. \n\nThe R-Rating was earned. I'm not sure if there were more F-Bombs or claws to the dome. There were a lot of F-Bombs and a lot of guys' skull stabbed with claws.\n\nHow about the action? A lot is made of the \""airport scene\"" in Captain America Civil War and rightfully so\, but there is a scene in Logan that after two viewing is easily my favorite action scene in comic book movie history. Especially considering this scene did not contain every iconic character under a brands umbrella fighting\, but rather just two. \n\nGreat action\, very good script\, and performances across the board that if this movie was not tied to \""comic books\"" would warrant awards consideration. As of this moment\, I could see Jackman nominated for Best Actor and the script nominated for Adapted Screenplay\, with an outside shot at Best Picture. With up to ten nominees now it is not an impossible feat.\n\nRecommendation: Well\, I think the movie is worth potentially three Oscar Nominations\, that it has the best individual performance by a character in in a comic book movie\, great performances all-around\, and boasts the best action scene in comic book movie history. Go. See. Move. This is a great\, great movie. Not a Great \""comic book\"" movie. A great movie...\n\nDo what you do best. Marvel keep with the tight structure\, DC with the dumpster fires\, and Fox just keep churning out these solid individual stories.",True,0.36870118975639343,0.36426857113838196,0.4159226417541504,0.3551923334598541,0.34011417627334595,0.36359643936157227,0.335094153881073,0.36217984557151794,0.3504027724266052

163738,Logan,2017-03-08,3,"QUICK REVIEW:\nGood news - We get the Wolverine we been dying to see for the past 20 years!\nBad News - He is old as f**k.\n\n[SLIGHT SPOILERS]\n\nThe moment was in 'X2: X-Men United' when we get the first glimpse of Wolverine going into his famous 'berserker' mode! The part when the soldiers attack the mansion. It was The Moment all of us Wolverine / X-Men fans were dying to see! We forgave the PG-13 rating as long as we got to see Wolvie go nuts\, slicing and dicing u bad guys. Sans blood.\n\n'Logan' makes up for Allllll the blood and guts that every PG-13 movie could never show. And that is a bit of a shame for this franchise. The first Wolverine movie was so horrendous that my commentary ends here. The second one gave us more action and more people to watch Wolverine kill\, but again...claws slicing people up without bloodshed was so ridiculous we still couldn't but into it.\n\nWe all love Wolverine because he is the ultimate anti-hero. He is absolutely TERRIFYING and you're glad he's on the good guys side. Notice I didn't say he IS a good guy. Like Punisher and Deadpool - Wolverine is that middle ground character who isn't evil\, but he isn't the most righteous person on the planet. He's that guy who doesn't mind carnage and mayhem to get results. If its for a greater 'good'? - then so be it.\n\nWhich brings me to LOGAN. I really want to like this movie. Hell\, I want to LOVE it. But seeing one of the greatest characters play out his final days\, ambling about like a lame\, coughing and wheezing and swearing\, while having occasional bouts of violent rages - not exactly the Wolverine I want to see. \n\nThe Wolverine WE get is in the year 2029 (which makes him well over 100 years old). He is shacked up with an impossibly fragile Professor X and - get this - CALIBAN. Why In god's name of ALLLLL the mutants to pick for Wolverine to spend his final days...WHY CALIBAN?? Caliban came across as a quasi-gay\, vampire caretaker dying of AIDS\, rather than a former mutant hunter for Apocalypse. I just couldn't buy into that dynamic. Why wouldn't Logan pick Jubilee or Storm\, or hell\, ANYONE?? anyone but CALIBAN. Geezus! lol\n\nSo Professor X is wasting away as the World's Most Powerful Psychic Invalid - and Wolverine is dying from what we assume is Adamantium poisoning. And Caliban is - well\, CALIBAN (lord.....smh)  the whole thing is a dreary mess.\n\nThat is\, until X-23 shows up!! :D :D \n\nThankfully\, this movie gets a dose of 'OH F**K DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?' once X-23 comes into the story line. So without giving anything away\, The Weapon X program was continued and the revelation is the 'x' is not the letter X but the number 10 - as in the Weapon #10\, the system tried 10x until the made Wolverine (hence\, Weapon X). Now here we flash forward into the future and the Weapon program has been cloning the powers of dead mutants with children. Some worked and some did not. Weapon #23 is a Wolverine clone (X-23)\, a female version! And damn she is a wild little Bad-azz!\n\nThe movie jumps into high gear from here. Well\, as high as it can get with three of the lamest broken down characters ever featured in the entire X-saga. Oh man its just pitiful seeing Logan/James Howlett hobbling about all dusty and crusty :(\n\nSo apparently something Very Very Terrible happened to every mutant on Earth and I guess only Wolverine and Professor X survived. And CALIBAN (Whyyyyyy....).\n\nAnyway. The Reavers are the bad guys and apparently Pierce is the one guy among plenty of cybernetic-enhanced mercenaries who seems to have any clue on how to fight a LAME Wolverine. And by lame I mean physically lame. He's on his last leg and still\, 50 bionic men can't stop him. That's a testament to both his legendary fighting prowess AND how ill-trained the bad guys were haha! :P\n\nI enjoyed every second of X-23\, but In the end this sad\, sad R-Rated blood-fest about our favorite heroic mutant maniac comes to a whimpering halt. \n\nAnd I'm exactly not happy about that. \n\nHopefully Bishop alters time and changes this shit.",True,0.002738254377618432,0.002707719337195158,0.0026994228828698397,0.0026661010924726725,0.0028872129041701555,0.002876929473131895,0.0027277718763798475,0.0028351268265396357,0.0033149071969091892

Well\, forget that.\n\nLogan takes place in 2029\, roughly 16 years after the events of Wolverine. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is now living the remainder of his life in Texas\, his body slowly decaying as a result of the adamantium poisoning his bones. The X-Men have disbanded and the remaining mutants are living in-hiding\, on the brink of extinction. Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart) is being held in isolation as a result of a neurodegenerative disease that induces random\, telepathic anomalies\, temporarily paralyzing those nearby.\n\nOne day\, Logan is recognized by Gabriela\, a nurse who possesses ties to a large corporation of biotechnology called Alkali-Transgien\, which plans to develop a breed of mutants and create a powerful legion of super-soldiers. However\, the initiative is scrapped and the mutants involved are to be disposed of. Gabriela refuses to go along with this and evacuates the children from captivity in search of a mutant sanctuary known as Eden.\n\nThus\, the bulk of the story begins.\n\nUnlike it's predecessor\, \""The Wolverine\""\, Logan is not filmed in British Columbia\, nor does it feel like anything based out of a comic book. The harsh environmental shift is a sharp twist in tone from previous entries that brilliantly supports its dark and violent direction. I'm not saying that the characters and storyline aren't backed up by the comic material - I'm saying that the final product is an astounding departure from traditional superhero-style movies.\n\nHugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart combine their remarkable chemistry in Wolverine's monumental finish to an eight-year franchise. Logan made me feel like I was living in a modern Terrell County\, Texas from \""No Country for Old Men\"". It possessed a cinematic quality that focused heavily on the environmental circumstances these characters were forced to deal with. It throws each character into a world where there are no safe havens\, except at journey's end; where the road they're following will be harsh and bitter. It's a story that focuses less on cinematic visual effects\, and more on the relationship of family and friends.\n\nThere is a scene in the movie that lasts nearly ten minutes; a peaceful moment in which the core players are socializing at the dinner table. While it doesn't serve a tremendous amount of significance to the plot\, it's a moment of appreciation for cinematic elements we don't necessarily see a whole lot in action-based comic book adaptations.",True,0.26985689997673035,0.33355262875556946,0.29678839445114136,0.34727346897125244,0.22448785603046417,0.24956217408180237,0.3055175840854645,0.2514229416847229,0.30678507685661316

I don't what what drugs John was on when he watched this movie\, but this was by FAR the WORST of the x-men movies too date!!\n\nWhile the action was good and the acting and the other elements of loss and pain\,  etc... People don't go to see movies too critique them from a critics point of view\,  nor are they looking for such specific attributes as the character experiencing loss or pain specifically\,  and wolverine has certainly had far too much of birth in his life.\n\nThe movie was Very confusing as NOTHING was explained AT ALL about what happened to the x-men\,  why was wolverine in such poor health\,  which was only slightly alluded to later on but with no explanation\, the mansion\,  Xavier's fortune... NOTHING!!\n\ni was waiting the entire movie for SOME kind of a dam explanation and got nothing\,  ESPECIALLY considering that in days of future past\,  the x-men were saved from annihilation\, everyone was at the school and happy including wolverine... Now it seems that they didn't actually stop the extinction of the x-men after all\,  it simply took a different form.  Instead of the sentinels destroying them\,  it's hinted that Xavier may have somehow caused their destruction accidentally\,  but again you're left hanging!\n\nThis is the first x-men movie I can actually say IT SUCKED! While everyone e else seemed to have issues with Wolverines origins\,  First Class\, the last stand\,  I and all my friends and family thought they were good to very good\, yet ALL of them were confused\, sometimes bored and kept losing interest in Logan.\n\nThe plot moved along very slowly\,  was way too much and unnecessary F bombs being dropped by wolverine\,  too much gore\,  took to long to even begin to explain anything and again it never Did EXPLAIN the most important questions... WHAT HAPPENED to the x-men\,  the mansion\,  Charles fortune and why are wolverines powers failing??\n\nI understand that for those DIE HARD Wolverine fans\, this movie is a dream because they just wanted to see him go nuts and finally DIE.. for some strange morbid reason I don't get which is apparently why so many loved this movie. \n\nMovies such as the first avengers\,  true lies\,  or terminator 2 are among some of the best because the plot kept going\,  everything fit into place\,  every scene had a purpose in moving the plot along\,  had great action and even the slower scenes still kept your interest and added to the overall flow\,  story and interest of the movie.  NONE of those elements were present in Logan. It may be good from A CRITICS point of view\,  but there is A HUGE reason why there are often such big gaps between what critics think and the audience thinks\,  because they're looking at it from a teacher grading a test point of view where as the paying audience is looking for story\,  explanation and to be entertained... None of which happened in this movie for me\,  my friends  family nor anyone else in the audience as everyone else seemed just as confused\, lost and disappointed as we were by this movie.\n\nI get that this was not really an X-men movie\, but you can't actually expect to have WOlverine and Xavier in this movie and not EXPECT people to consider it an X-Men movie.. it's just ridiculous. I would have been far better IF there were explanations to the questions mentioned but there was none at all. \n\nAgain\,  just A TERRIBLE and mostly BORING movie and the first of any X-men movie I can actually say...

167173,Logan,2017-03-05,4,"Since his debut on screen in 2000's X-Men\, grizzled mutant Logan aka Wolverine became a fan favourite\, the poster boy for the then budding new series and a career defining role for Australia's very own favourite son Hugh Jackman.\n\nA lot has changed since that memorable debut in Bryan Singer's well-liked comic book hit\, for Wolverine as a character\, most of that revolves around a lot of crumby cameos and forgettable solo adventures but proving once and for all that good things come to those that wait\, Jackman and his The Wolverine director James Mangold have decided enough was enough and finally given the many fans of the clawed mutant the film they've been calling out for.\n\nLogan\, a downright glum and violent affair is very far from the \""perfect\"" film but considering where this character has come from and where it seemed like he was likely to stay\, Mangold's film is one worthy of the name and this Western inspired road trip provides a sense of closure when it comes to the Wolverine name\, in that we can finally say Jackman did all he could with this creation that gave birth to his enjoyable international career.\n\nA film that ends up being slightly too long in the claw\, Logan is 130 minutes of dust covered\, blood strewn and anti-children's entertainment that leverages Marvel's new found \""older\"" audience targeting that did them so well with Deadpool and their Netflix events\, as a now withered and old Logan is trying to live a quiet life as a driver for hire whilst supporting an ailing Professor X only to be thrown headfirst into a violent battle to protect mutant child Laura who acts as a surrogate daughter to the bearded ex-hero.\n\nThis set-up allows Mangold and Jackman to explore Logan on a deeper level\, as the near suicidal man struggles to find meaning behind his sombre existence and Jackman delivers his best turn yet as the character while many fanboys will appreciate the time he gets to spend with Professor X (who I would argue gets too much screen time uttering Logan's name on repeat for the majority) and it's a chance to finally see the famed mutant act out some seriously impressive carnage.\n\nThe action in Logan is where the film truly shines and from the film's opening minutes you're acutely aware that this is not a film you'll be watching with the younger members of your family.\n\nLimbs are lopped\, chopped\, sliced and diced and Mangold isn't afraid to linger on the killing that sometimes needs to be done and for all those years we've endured rather forgettable Wolverine fight scenes\, Logan certainly does more than enough to make up for this.\n\nWith action a high point of the film\, Logan's not so amazing moments come from a story that starts to drag come the final stretches and with a finale that will be far from many people's memories come a few months' time\, it feels as though Logan wasn't entirely sure of itself when it came to delivering the goods come the films conclusion.\n\nIt's nice to see Marvel shy away from \""city destruction\"" and an evil villain that just wants to take over the world but you can't help but feel the earlier beginnings of Logan signposted a far more \""epic\"" final act\, not one with a bunch of children running around a forest and a bottle of peptides.\n\nA fine final outing for Jackman and his Wolverine to be a part of\, Logan is without doubt the best solo Wolverine adventure and easily one of the best X-Men orientated feature films that draws out Jackman's best performance in some time and introduces us to newcomer Dafne Keen\, who does a great job in her portrayal of Laura.\n\nThere's nothing truly ground-breaking here but it's certainly refreshing to see Marvel willing to keep expanding their horizons and deliver different takes on stories and characters that have flooded our cinema screens for nearly two decades and while this overlong trip is lacking a little in the emotional stakes and features a few to many corny circumstances\, it's unlikely the images of Logan enacting out his sweet form of justice will be forgotten anytime soon.\n\n3  1/2 bowls of cornflakes out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",True,0.5238656401634216,0.5853502154350281,0.4401511549949646,0.5605423450469971,0.47680437564849854,0.5050331354141235,0.3837849497795105,0.5877136588096619,0.5371032953262329
167174,Logan,2017-01-24,4,"Since his first appearance in 'X-Men' in 2000\, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has been the franchise's most popular character and\, in every film he's featured in\, never fails to be anything less than a complex and compelling character to watch. 'Logan' showcases Jackman's best performance of the clawed mutant and this is mainly because we see a completely different side to him.

167797,Logan,2020-02-21,5,"So finally we get an 18-rated Wolverine movie inspired by an epic comic and steered by Mangold going (yet again) Full-Western. Wolverine aka Logan aka James goes full bloody berserker many\, many times\, he swears\, he drinks\, he swears a lot and he slices and dices through human limbs\, tears their faces apart and impales the bloody heck out of every bald\, beard-toting cyborg.\n\nAnd then X24 turns up and we truly see an empathy-less beserker-rage-filled Wolverine\, an unstoppable killing machine\, we get what we want\, and it's horrible\, it's so horrific and heartless that we'd give anything to have broken\, sad\, kind-hearted\, scuffed-up and ultimately soft Logan back. It's a clever sly touch to let us have our cake and eat it and it shows much of Mangold's steady eye over this film.\n\nAnd it's this use of themes that burst through the fourth wall\, these not so super problems that allow us to relate to the characters and ramps up the stakes and the heart; Charles' WMD mind\, he's a danger to himself and others\, his degenerative brain disease mirrors the Alzheimer's that grip my grandparents and my friends family members.\, it's touching and truly made me laugh and cry. The Logan/Caliban odd couple thing is expertly conceived; facilitating story details and adding a dimension to the world Logan's been living in. His world smashed\, his purpose lost\, most of the events prior to this film are left purposely and effectively unspoken or spoken about only in passing. What little is talked about of the past is respectful\, sparing and clever. It's a fusion of good cinema\, good writing\, good conception and execution in almost every scene.\n\nAnd the action. The R-Rated brutality is shocking but beautifully blocked\, shot and cut\, the effects are concrete\, blood effects look like proper chunks of gore and Logan and X23 twirl and dodge and make thrilling\, pulse-pounding and frightening sequences. The time freeze in the hotel with Logan tearing up the walls is a super nod to Xavier's power in X2 and mirrors Samurai/Western standoffs\, with all the men collapsing at once after. Effective stuff. The fact that the car can't just snap through their own fence just works\, Xavier using his powers to calm horses just works\, the impromptu dinner scene just works\, Laura's learning about the world just works\, the cyborg hands ripped straight out of Metal Gear Solid 5 just works. It's part Collateral/late Michael Mann\, part Western\, and part The Last of Us. \n\nAnd it looks fucking beautiful; underrated legend John Mathieson invigorates every scene with an otherworldly fantasy-like beauty and gritty realism at the same time; his trademark which grounds the film and doesn't rely on the saturation and flat clean colours of something like Fury Road. Mangold's framing is spot on\, the man knows how to compose creative and fluid scenes without imposing himself on it. And Beltrami's score is a beautiful\, lyrical swansong\, a different dirge that leads you to the inevitable close of the series. \n\nIt's not all roses: The Ravagers are underexplained\, comically destroying villains before their master plan has been revealed is a double-edged sword in terms of effectiveness\, and the use of X24 is sudden\, undercooked\, a little blurry and clearly messy. One wonders how well this film will fare on a second viewing which is maybe why they're plumming for the Noir version ASAP\, but after Mad Max: Black & Chrome\, that may not be a bad thing.\n\nBut it's a testament to Mangold's repurposing of the Western\, the source material of Old Man Logan and the legacy of Singer's X-Men\, and the perfect folding of these expectations together that manages to keep it constantly fresh with an edge-of-your-seat curiosity. \n\nPatrick Stewart does some of his finest work swearing and lashing out and vulnerable and bright-eyed just like most of us as our brains degenerate\, Stephen Merchant brings the exact right empathy and humour\, Laura is a little terror delight\, not once annoying\, both cute and deadly\, but the star of the show is Hugh Jackman whose moving portrayal is two-fold\, the actor's sadness and revelry of the role that made him as he lets it go\, channeled through a guilt and remorse-ridden Wolverine who's seen it all\, done worse and is ready to let go. His palpable emotion and pain are all so raw he gives his best performance since The Fountain. In what is clearly one of the best comic book movies and action movies of all time.\n\nX",True,0.7839758992195129,0.7670521140098572,0.7763373255729675,0.7833189368247986,0.6162208318710327,0.7787375450134277,0.7481027841567993,0.7748143672943115,0.7586031556129456

167898,Logan,2017-02-24,5,"So if you take Star Wars Episode 8: The Last Jedi out of the picture for a second then Logan is pretty much my most anticipated film of the year\, X-men is one of the things I loved watching growing up and the first movie in particular has a special place in my heart not just for being one of my favourite super hero movies of all time but for changing the game for superhero movies in general. Before that movie came out we were still being treated to really campy and clichéd super hero movies and while some are still remembered as classics others failed to disastrous effect. X-men changed the game in introducing audiences to a more serious and thought provoking type Super hero movie and did it far better than every other Super hero movie that came out around the same. Say what you will about the first Blade movie and while I admit it's a good movie I find very campy at times. \nI was really excited for not just because I love\, most of the X -men movies\, but because this movie is in effect the last time we'll ever see Hugh Jackman portray the iconic hero. When Hugh Jackman was playing wolverine in the first X-men movie he was only 17. That's how long he's been playing this character and is still to this day my favourite character in the entire franchise. But as a franchise of now 10 films there were really only 5 of these movies that I considered great movies those being\, X-men\, X-men 2\, X-men first Class\, X-men Days of Future Past and Deadpool. Well\, apologies for the really clichéd sentence I'm about to say here\, but now there 6 of these movies that I consider fantastic and Logan might just as well be the best film in the entire franchise.\nLogan is one of the most emotional theatre experiences I've ever had and I'm really glad to actually say that this movie surpassed my expectations by a long shot\, this movie was absolutely incredible.\nOne of the biggest things in this movie that seriously deserves praise here is the films well deserved R-rating. This film does not hold back at all in terms of how bloody it can get\, I would even say this movie is even more gruesome than Deadpool which is really saying something there\, after flipping 17 years we finally have a gory as all heck Wolverine movie. This movie was so graphic\, so bloody and just gruesome and I absolutely loved it. Seeing Wolverine decapitating people left and right is just so exhilarating it's unbelievable. The action in this movie is by far the best action in the entire franchise period. They are shot superbly well\, showing every graphic detail in all its gory glory and masterfully choreographed and the most realistic action sequences I've really ever seen in a superhero movie. \nMaking our main character vulnerable in this movie was an excellent decision because in every action sequence there's just this feeling of suspense and vulnerability because you know that at any moment our hero could be killed\, which again is something I have to praise the film for. It makes the main characters vulnerable\, Wolverine is not doing well\, he's sick\, he's not healing the way he used to and has basically given up on all hope at this point\, and Charles Xavier is suffering dearly from a mental illness\, mutants as a species are declining. Making our main characters vulnerable really adds to the films sense of dread and suspense.\nAnd speaking of the movies characters\, Hugh Jackman gives probably the best performance of his entire career; he was so good in this movie. Seeing Wolverine in this emotionally broken state with literally no hope left inside him is really heart breaking to watch. His powers aren't what they used to be\, he's vulnerable in this movie which actually made me care for this character even more\, every single scene in this movie had me thinking\, \""please don't die\, oh please\, please don't\"". It's a great way to build character and a really intriguing premise that I haven't seen done this well in a superhero movie\, and brings a very creative and original twist the superhero movie genre as a whole.\nAnd do I really need to tell you guys that Patrick Stewart was absolutely fantastic in this movie\, I mean common\, this is Patrick Stewart we're talking about here\, but I'm going to tell ya any way cause why not. I found Charles Xavier to be a really engaging character in this movie\, I actually found a lot of his scenes to be very emotional\, but at the same time he stole the show in terms of comedy he had quite a few comedic lines that landed perfectly and did have me laughing my spagbowl off. In fact that again is something I've got to praise\, while there is very little humour in this movie\, it is very effective and never once betrayed the tone of the movie.\nAnd speaking of the tone\, I really appreciated the fact that I was watching a marvel movie that had the balls to be a really dark in terms of the tone even if it is a marvel movie it was technically made by 20th century fox. Like a said there are small pockets of humour scattered throughout the film but for the most part it sustains an appropriately dark tone that never really feels unwelcomed and works to the films advantage\, which actually makes feel glad that this movie was not made by Marvel. Now hold on there fan boys\, I'm not saying the MCU is stupid\, I flipping love that franchise but even I have to admit that even when you compare films like Captain America: the Winter Soldier\, Avengers Age of Ultron and even Captain America Civil War as much I hate to admit it have never really proven they have the balls to make a much more serious\, dark and gritty superhero film such as Logan\, which is why at least for now\, I'm glad that the X-men films are not currently being made by Marvel because I really feel that the tone presented in the MCU would mesh well with the X-men franchise particularly if you try to mesh it with characters like Wolverine himself for instance. So please put down your pitch forks and torches I'm just saying I prefer the current darker tone these films have compared to most MCU movies.\nI have to admit though the absolute best performance in this movie along sisde Hugh Jackman has to be Daphne keen as Laura AKA X-23\, she blew my mind in this movie\, her performance was so good\, she gave a performance that was just as good as Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart himself which that in itself is an accomplishment. Not only was this character very interesting and just a fascinating character in general but she had some amazing action sequences that like all the other action sequences were shot and choreographed flawlessly. The chemistry between her and Logan was spot on and I really enjoyed seeing their new found farther and daughter relationship grow as the film progressed and it's through their relationship that writer and director James Mangold addresses how important family really is in life\, which I really feel is a strong message to the viewers as well as a really effective and compelling way of adding more emotionally absorbing drama to the film. \nHowever the biggest praise I can really give this movie is that in a sense this superhero movie for people who really don't like superhero movies. Let just take a moment to explain myself here. This is not just a movie made for people who love the comics\, movies and the characters that inhabit this film\, but it's also a superhero film for people who are tired of seeing a superhero movie where the main character is always in some sort of costume or spandex\, with the same sort of structure no matter how differently it's told coupled with lots of jokes and unrealistic action sequence\, personally love a bit of all of that in movies but at the same time I can really see how that would be the main reason for someone who is not a fan of the genre would  actually like this movie.\nThere is no spandex or any kind of costume in this movie\, the characters are vulnerable and not in any way shape or form invincible with the possibility of death around every corner\, the story isn't about our heroes trying to save the world\, in fact there on the run trying to protect this girl from people who want to use her for bad things. There's a much darker and grimmer tone present and it can get really emotional at times\, I will admit I was actually crying at one point.  \nSo my overall thoughts on Logan is that I think this is an incredible movie\, there has never really been a superhero movie in the past that has really been as unique or emotionally investing as the film was. Not only is this the saddest and most depressing X-men movie but I'm full on whiling to say that Logan is the best X-men movie and not even kidding the best comic book movie of all time. Logan not only met my expectations it surpassed them by a mile stone.",True,0.6778218746185303,0.6648423671722412,0.6254741549491882,0.6696174740791321,0.6097192764282227,0.6764789819717407,0.5957779288291931,0.6837916374206543,0.6049619317054749

I feel it was a little rushed because a ton of details are missing. I wanted less blood and gore and more mutant powers.

169110,Logan,2017-03-09,3,"So\, went and saw Logan and I have to say I am not happy.  Yeah\, Hugh Jackman was great as always (he will forever be Wolverine) and the fight scenes were as absolutely amazing as they were graphic. I can see how anyone not familiar with Wolverine from the comic would love this movie\, but\, any true X-Men and Wolverine fan will immediately notice that the story line is all wrong.  Yes\, I know that the Marvel universe is a multi-verse and that there are multiple story and time lines\, but\, if you are going to make a movie you need to stick to the mainstream universe for the story (for all you non comic book geeks that would be Earth-616).  The most egregious deviation is X-23's origin. Spoiler alert - Laura Kinney\, which by the way is her full name\, is 100% a clone of Logan made from a sample of his DNA that had a damage Y chromosome and therefore they could only use the X chromosome and that is why she is female.  There was no female DNA (i.e. mother of Mexican descent) used to create her.  100% test tube baby implanted in Dr. Sarah Kinney who gave birth to X-23.  Laura was raised in the lab by Sarah\, who she saw as her mother\, not this Nurse Gonzales person.  Sarah also helped X-23 escape from the \""Facility\"" in NYC.  Ironically\, Laura ends up killing Sarah in a blind rage caused by the \""trigger scent\"" that she has been conditioned to react to.  Next\, would be the fact that X-23 is not Hispanic\, if anything she would be Canadian since that is what Logan is\, nor does she ever speak Spanish in the comic books\, though she does initially not speak very much.  Also\, she was a little older (by a couple of years) when she met Wolverine for the first time and new him for several years before he died\, which was in a much different manner.  She did come to see him as a father figure and was very protective of him.  So\, she is X-23 because she was the 23rd attempt at cloning Wolverine (the prior 22 were male and failed experiments) not because there were 22 other children. I am not saying that the \""Facility\"" didn't clone other mutants but that is not how she became to be known as X-23.  There was a X-24 through X-50 attempted latter on but Laura killed all those before they ever left the lab.  So\, not the last thing wrong with the movie\, but\, the last one I will mention and that is - Xavier should not be there.  In the Earth-616 universe he was killed by Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops a little over 4 years ago when Cyclops was possessed  by the Phoenix Force.

After see Logan for the first time let me tell you it is not a typical action movie that only stays in your mind for a few minutes after watching. It leaves a residue. It causes you to stare at that screen as the credits roll by\, at that road as you drive home and think. You knew going in that there were of course two options with Wolverine he was either going to die or walk off into that glorious sunset\, with Laura\, never to be seen again. I of course was hoping for the latter. But it was not to be. The course of the entire movie was logan coming to grips with\, in his mind\, a pointless reality and waiting for that perfect time to put an adamantium bullet in his head through tissue that couldnt regenerate (sorry guys i disagree with the comics on this one\, been in the medical field too long to think brain cells can regenerate). Anyways\, his life hits a major bump when he comes across this girl\, who hardly says a word. She is seeing many things for the first time and is expecting logan to be a person that she has only read about in comics. The meat of the movie involves a constant struggle to escape the trackers. But it also centers around the mans ability to take someone into his life again and push away that fear that that person would simply be added to the list of those killed around him. That final seen where he lay dieing and says \""laura\"" and she responds \""daddy\"" just grabs your heart and squeezes... and squeezes for the next 15 minutes. Your saddened not only because of his death but because of the fact that she will not grow up with a father. A father that just realized how important she was to him... It crushes you. it really does. Anyways thats what I got from Mr. Mangold and I'm sure there are going to be people that completely disagree but that's fine to me.

169458,Logan,2017-03-10,4,"SPOILERS \nAlthough Logan brings in new aspects with its new R rating by adding brutal violence and language throughout\, Logan is a great movie with new aspects yet some bad and mediocre things throughout. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Logan/Wolverine in this movie is his best yet by bring not just his sorrow and anger like other installments\, but by bringing his level of tiredness and father like figure to new levels that we've never seen before. \nThe CGI in this movie was pretty mediocre compared to other big budget action/superhero movies\, with most of the CGI looking fake or just flat out weak compared to the other installments in the X-men franchise. Logan brings brutality like no other in this film\, but what it lacks in is story telling. When we first get introduced to what the plot could be we are already about 30 minuets in\, what we think is wrong with Logan during the movie is a number of things; he's either getting sick from the adamantium in his body\, or he's still sick from what happened in the previous sequel The Wolverine with the squid in his lungs. Professor Xavier is also sick but does not get elaberated on; when the scientists comes and talks to Caliban the doctor asks if the professor has ALS implying he doesn't know and doesn't let us know if it is ALS or not. Also we find out that the X-men are gone what we think was just caused by government type agency's\, but then find out the whole time it was professor X's fault. What did he do? He finally addresses this later in the movie\, but by the time he's ready to say what happened they kill him off. \nMost of the R rated moments are uneccessary\, many of the times Logan and the professor drop the F bomb they seem to be throwing at the audience hey look at us we're R now\, and not really helping the film in any way. The movie doesn't seem to address the issue of being a sequel\, you start the movie lost with the fact of what is going on whether it be if you have seen the other wolverine movies or not. Although Logan's brutal end is a spectacular one\, there are many issues that need addressing with what the professors diease is\, what Logan's disease is\, and how the plot is all over the place in the first few moments.

170755,Logan,2018-01-15,5,"Strengths: Honestly\, any praise for a Wolverine film starts with Hugh Jackman. Even when giving trash to work with (X-Men Origins)\, he gives his all and embodies the character. But this was just on another level. It was easily his finest performance in the role. He brought a vulnerability to it\, while still maintaining how much of a badass he is. Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier) has also never been better as Professor X. It was a unique take on both characters\, but the veteran actors brought their \""A\"" games to take it to the next level and make it all work brilliantly. It wasn't just the vets\, though. Dafne Keen (Laura) absolutely shines in a huge role. She barely speaks\, yet conveys a lot in her facial expressions. Once she does open up\, it's even better. If you don't get emotional when she mutters\, \""Daddy\"" near the end of the film\, you might not have a soul. This packs more of an emotional punch than any superhero film I can recall. Don't let the emotional stuff fool you\, as it has some gloriously violent moments. One thing this masterfully juggled was the relationships between the three main characters. I loved everything between Charles & Logan\, Logan & Laura and the small Laura/Charles stuff.\n\nWeaknesses: There's not much to dislike about Logan. If I had to pick something\, it would be that the villains aren't very defined. Most of the film plays out like a lengthy chase. With the focus on Logan/Laura/Charles\, and rightfully so\, the antagonists get pushed to the side. While X-24 (a younger Logan clone) proved to be a formidable foe\, I never fully got invested or interested in Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) or Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant).\n\nOverall: 2017 was a year for great superhero films for the most part. I've seen all the Marvel ones and this was on par or above Spider-Man and Thor\, which were excellent. The violence and action scenes were top notch\, but it was the emotional moments and character work that made Logan stand out.

You knew this was the last time you'd see this character played by this actor\, and you felt ok about it. At its heart this is a story about losing family.

176041,Logan,2017-03-04,5,"The main issue with the first two Wolverine films were that they weren't Logan's stories.  Stories that just happened to star Hugh Jackman with claws and healing ability.  Luckily\, James Mangold rights the ship with 'Logan'.  Deservingly brutal and heartbreaking\, 'Logan' is the perfect send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17-year tenure playing the character.\n\n'Logan' accomplished one of the hardest things the third in a trilogy can do\, get better with every outing.  But 'Logan' isn't just better than the previous two Wolverine films\, it's one of the greatest comic-book films of all time.  Ironically\, besides a few references and the appearance of an actual X-Men comic\, it's far from your usual run of the mill comic-book adventure.  'Logan' sees a man just waiting for his time to come while taking care of the man who once took care of him\, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart).  It's  beautiful symmetry that way\, as is the appearance of the clone\, X-23/Laura.  Laura\, equipped with the same healing ability and adamantium clones as Wolverine\, makes for a nice counterpart to Logan.  And really\, all 3 main characters have great chemistry as some of the few mutants left in the world.\n\nNeither Jackman or Stewart has ever been better as their respected mutants.  Giving these characters their own mortality is the best thing the script could have done.  It's one of the reasons people have given up on most superhero-related films\, they tend to be predictable and without consequence.  Yes\, it's always been fun to watch Wolverine rip through dozens of bad guys without a second glance\, but it's about time we see his body struggle as much as his mind has through the years.  Losing all the people he has through nine films doesn't exactly put his mind in the best place.\n\nWhich is why having Laura be in this film is so integral.  Logan needed to see someone with similar abilities\, but at a time where she needs guidance and a father-figure.  Which again\, mirrors Logan's first trip to the X-mansion back in 2000's X-Men.  Which brings me to the next brilliant thing about 'Logan'.  It's uniqueness make seeing all of the previous X-Men films only recommended viewing.  It's connected in a way\, but you don't need to see the other films in order to feel the weight of every moment.  With that said\, knowing everything that this character has gone through certainly enhances the experience.  Without spoiling the 3rd act\, I don't think there will ever be anything quite like 'Logan'.  Perhaps not since the ending of The Dark Knight Trilogy have I felt this kind of emotion.\n\nIt's been well documented just how ultra-violent 'Logan' is\, but I never felt the violence over took the characters and story.  For once\, we got a Wolverine story that was actually his own story\, and it paid off.  I don't need to see any more of Wolverine in the X-Men universe\, at least for a long time.  I got the violence and emotional payoff that I wanted from this character.  Words cannot describe this experience\, and only time will tell just how well this film holds up.\n\n+Perfect send-off\n\n+Separated from the universe but honors what came before\n\n+Laura/X-23\n\n+Ultra-violent\n\n+Mortal Wolverine and Professor X\n\n10/10",True,0.29778993129730225,0.31860798597335815,0.27886059880256653,0.3141072988510132,0.3009112775325775,0.29686281085014343,0.27814334630966187,0.30394425988197327,0.26161861419677734

Jackman is great as well as Patrick Stewart who is the glue of the film for me. Boyd Holbrook is wasted as Pierce\, the \""main\"" villain.

179561,Logan,2017-03-03,2,"The Wolverine is one of the most popular characters in the history of comic books. He has been ranked #4 by IGN (Imagine Games Network) and #1 by \""Wizard\"" magazine. The brooding X-Man mutant with the long\, retractable claws and healing powers has been featured in several Marvel comic book series since the 1970s\, not to mention video games\, TV series and\, of course\, films. Hugh Jackman has played the character in almost all of the X-Men films\, including three based solely on his character. In 2009\, \""X-Men Origins: Wolverine\"" takes the character from his childhood in 1840s Canada through several wars and into league with Professor Xavier and the X-Men. 2013's \""Wolverine\"" is set mostly in modern Japan and sees the title character struggling with the \""curse\"" of his invulnerability. 2017's \""Logan\"" (R\, 2:17) is inspired by the 2008 graphic novel \""Old Man Logan\"". It takes place in the near future\, shows an aging Wolverine as anything but invulnerable and is intended to be the character's final appearance on film. \n\n2029. El Paso\, Texas. Wolverine / Logan (Jackman) is working as a limo driver. He's not the mutant he once was. Far from it. The alloy adamantium\, which gave his skeleton and claws such strength\, is poisoning him. He's slowly dying. And he's not the only one. For a variety of reasons\, mutants everywhere are dying off and Charles Xavier / Professor X himself (Patrick Stewart) seems set to join them soon. Logan has Xavier stashed at an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Juarez\, Mexico. A mutant called Caliban (Stephen Merchant) is caring for the ailing Professor and Logan brings him medications that he purchases illegally in El Paso. Xavier is suffering from a form of dementia and\, when he has one of his seizures\, the powers of his mind that had served him so well in the past\, cause tremors and considerable discomfort for those nearby. It's not a happy life for any of these men\, but it is a quiet\, anonymous and relatively peaceful one. That is\, until Logan's past catches up to him once again.  \n\nLogan is surprised to encounter Laura (Dafne Keen)\, an 11-year-old mutant who needs Logan's help\, but he wants no part of her problems. Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez)\, a nurse at a secret surgical clinic called Transigen\, begs Logan to help Laura get to North Dakota\, to a place called Eden\, which is supposed to be a refuge for young mutants. Laura is being pursued by Transigen's evil surgical head\, Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant)\, and his ruthless head of security\, Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook)\, who has with him a private army of cybernetic soldiers called the Reavers. Soon\, Logan has no choice but to step up and protect Xavier and Laura. What follows is a road trip from hell\, with Reavers in hot pursuit\, Logan and Xavier both suffering physically and mentally and with some major revelations along the way.\n\n\""Logan\"" brings Wolverine's story to a satisfying conclusion\, but it's only somewhat entertaining. The tone seems darker and more violent than previous Wolverine movies (if that's possible). There's plenty of action\, including fight scenes with generous amounts of blood and gore\, but the story is smaller\, more personal and more emotional. It's a good mix of action-driven and character-driven\, but can be difficult to watch. It's almost overwhelmingly depressing\, the extreme violence cheapens human life more than most action movies and the frequent use of adult language (all of it involving children) is disturbing. Wolverine fans may enjoy this final chapter\, but there are better action movies out there. \""C+\""",True,0.17758436501026154,0.1783241182565689,0.1725466549396515,0.16869115829467773,0.16843706369400024,0.15948154032230377,0.16352880001068115,0.173892542719841,0.16269566118717194

179585,Logan,2017-03-03,5,"The Wolverine solo films have not been good movies. The 2008 first film was widely lambasted and while it made its money it was obvious artistic misfire. The second film\, The Wolverine\, directed by James Mangold was an improvement even though it had its silly moments and fell apart with a contrived final confrontation. The Wolverine movies were definitely the lesser unworthy sidekick to the X-Men franchise\, and this was a franchise that recently suffered from the near abysmal Apocalypse. Mangold returns for another Wolverine sequel but I was cautious. And then the cheerfully profane Deadpool broke box-office records and gave the Fox execs the latitude needed for a darker\, bloodier\, and more adult movie that's more interested in character regrets than toy tie-ins. Thank goodness for the success of Deadpool because Logan is the X-Men movie\, and in particular the Wolverine movie\, I've been waiting for since the mutants burst onto the big screen some seventeen years ago. It is everything you could want in a Wolverine movie.\n\nIn the year 2029\, and mutants have become all but extinct. Logan (Jackman) is keeping a low profile as a limo driver and taking care of an ailing Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) south of the border. Xavier is losing his mind and a danger to others with his out-of-control psychic powers that need to be drugged. Caliban (Stephen Merchant) is also helping\, a light-sensitive mutant with the ability to innately track people across the globe. Logan is ailing himself as his healing power is dwindling and he can't keep up with the steady poison of his adamantium bones. A scared Mexican nurse tries to convince Logan to help out the little girl in her care\, Laura (Dafne Keen\, feral and a better non-verbal actor). She's an angry\, violent child and built from the DNA of Logan. She too has unbreakably sharp claws and a healing ability. Bounty hunter Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) is trying to recapture the runaway merchandise/science experiment\, capturing Caliban and torturing him to track his prey. Logan goes on the run with Xavier and trying to make sense of what to do with Laura\, a.k.a. X-23. They're headed north to Eden\, a hypothetical refuge for mutants to sneak over into freedom in Canada\, and along the way are deadly hunters who aren't afraid of leaving behind a trail of bodies to get their girl back.\n\nIt feels like it shouldn't haven taken Jackman's reported final outing for the execs to realize that a guy with freaking knives attached to his hands might be a concept that would work in the more grisly\, more adult territory an R-rating creatively affords. It's about time this man got to fully use his claws\, and it was a joyous explosion of violence and gore that has been built up for fans such as myself for a long time coming. It feels like Fox has been planning for this event as well\, as if they stationed a production lackey to devise all sorts of grotesquely fun ways that Wolverine might skewer his competition in bloody beauty (\""Finally\, your preparation will not be in vain\, Ronald\""). There's one scene in particular where a bunch of armed henchmen are psychically frozen in place and Logan struggles but moves past each\, and we get to anticipate just how each one will be viciously stabbed. For a series that has shied away from overly gory violence\, Logan certainly celebrates its new opportunities with bloody glee. The fact that the first word spoken is an f-bomb and there's a gratuitous moment of drunken sorority girl boob flashing is like the producers trying to directly communicate to the millions of ticket buyers and saying\, \""Hey\, we're sorry it took so long. Hope it was worth the wait.\"" Oh dear reader\, it was worth the wait.\n\nIt's not just the action that's invigorating but the emotional core of the film is deeper and more compelling and ruminative than ever before\, and finally these great actors are given material to deliver great performances worth of their talent. Stewart and Jackman have never been bad in their respective roles even if and when the movies have been. They just have never been called upon for much more than genre heroics\, anguish\, and moral dilemmas. With Logan\, both actors are finally given meaty material that affords nuance and ambiguity\, and they are excellent. Charles Xavier is losing his battle with Alzheimer's and ALS\, which is a major concern when his mind is considered a weapon of mass destruction by the government. He's going through his own end of life deliberations (\""You're waiting for me to die\,\"" he groans at Logan) and it brings out a far different Xavier we've ever seen\, even with the youthful cockiness from James McAvoy. This is a cranky\, defiant\, and doddering Xavier\, someone who is barely outpacing his sense of grief\, guilt\, and depression. There's a tragic back-story we only get a glimpse of but it's suitably devastating for a man who has devoted his life to others. He's looking for a few last moments of grace and looking to hold onto something by journey's end.\n\nThanks to his healing ability and the star wattage of Jackman\, there was little fear that anything serious would ever befall Wolverine in his many previous film appearances. Sure bad things happened to him and he lost plenty of female love interests\, but you never feared that he wouldn't be able to ultimately handle himself. That's not the case in Logan\, which opens with a Wolverine who has clearly lost more than a step or two. He's tried\, rundown\, and his adamantium skeleton is slowly poisoning his body. His healing powers are slowing down and he's not as berserker fast and agile as he used to be. For once there's an uncertainty attached to the character and vulnerability. This turn greatly increases the intensity of the fight sequences and the greater stakes of the drama. The comparisons of the samurai were rife in The Wolverine and now the comparisons to the aging\, lone gunslinger are ever-present in Logan. He's drawn into a conflict that he was not seeking and he's found a little bit of his remaining humanity and compassion to do right in the face of overwhelming odds and near certain self-destruction. There's a subtle moment that the film doesn't even dwell on that stuck with me. It's after an accident\, and in the thick of confusion\, Logan is trying to save his mentor but he's also worried that Xavier will think he betrayed him. \""It wasn't me\,\"" he repeats over and over\, not wanting this man to suffer more. It's a small moment that doesn't get much attention and yet it really spoke of their relationship and the depth of feeling during these fraught final days. This is the first Wolverine movie that feels like the characters matter as human beings just as much as purveyors of punching and kicking (now with gruesome slashing at no extra cost). Jackman showcases more than his impressive physique this go-round; he delivers a wounded performance that's built upon generations of scars that he's been ignoring. It's the serious character examination we've been waiting for.\n\nI also want to single out Merchant (Extras) who gives a performance I never would have anticipated from the awkwardly comedic beanpole. He even gets a badass moment and I never would have thought Stephen Merchant would ever have a badass moment in life.\n\nMangold's film plays as a love letter to Western cinema and uses the genre trappings in ways to further comment on the characters and their plight. This is a bleak movie. It's not a dystopia. In fact it resembles our own world pretty closely with a few technological additions; automated machines and trucks\, the common knowledge that mutants have been wiped out like the measles. Knowing that it's reportedly the end for Stewart and Jackman playing these characters\, I was anticipating the film to strike an elegiac chord. His past and legacy are catching up with him. He becomes an unlikely guardian to Laura and explores a fatherhood dynamic that was never afforded to him before. The unlikely partnership\, and it is a partnership as she's a pint-sized chip off the block of her tempestuous father\, blossoms along a cross-country road trip for a paradise that may or may not exist\, while desperadoes and powerful black hat villains are out to impose their will upon the weak. This is explored in a leisurely pit stop with a working class family (welcome back\, Eriq La Sale) that welcomes Logan and his posse into their home. We get a small respite and learn about greedy landowners trying to pressure them into giving up the family farm. It's completely reminiscent of something you might see in a classic Western of old\, just transported to a new setting. There's even an extended bit where Laura watches 1953's Shane on TV\, and when those final words come back in expected yet clunky fashion\, I'd be lying if they didn't push the right emotions at the right time.\n\nBut when it comes to action\, Logan more than satisfies. The action is cleanly orchestrated by Mangold in fluid takes that allow the audience to readily engage. The film doesn't go overboard on the Grand Guignol and lose sight of the key aspects of great action sequences. There's a refreshing variety of the action and combat\, and the action is framed tightly to the characters and their goals. It makes for an exhilarating viewing. If there is anything I would cite as a detriment for an otherwise incredible sendoff\, I think the movie peaks too soon action-wise. The emotional climax is definitely where it ought to be (tears will be shed whether you like it or not) but the third act action doesn't have quite the pop. Also\, while Holbrook (Narcos) is an entertaining and slyly charismatic heavy\, the villains in the movie are kept relatively vague as is their overall plan. The vacuum of villainy is kept more one-dimensional\, which is fine as it allows more complexity and character moments to be doled out to our heroes\, but it is a noticeable missing element.\n\nOne of the best attributes I cited from last year's Captain America: Civil War is that the full weight of the character histories was felt\, giving real emotional stakes to all the explosions and moralizing. When our characters went toe-to-toe\, we felt a dozen films' worth of setup that made the conflict matter. Logan carries that same emotional weight. We've been watching Wolverine and Professor Xavier for almost two decades and across nine films. These characters have gotten old\, tired\, and they carry their years like taciturn gunslingers looking for solitude and trying to justify the regrets of their lives. It's a surprisingly emotional\, serious\, and altogether mature final chapter\, one that provides just as many enjoyable character moments and stretches of ruminative silence as it does jolts of gritty\, dirty\, hard-charging action and bloody violence. It's as much a character study as it is a superhero movie or Western. I cannot imagine this story as a watered down\, PG-13 neutered version of what I saw on screen. This is a movie for adults and it pays great justice to the characters and the demands of the audience. The final image is note-perfect and can speak volumes about the ultimate legacy of Wolverine and by extension Xavier and his school for gifted youngsters.

180189,Logan,2020-11-03,5,"The X-Men franchise has had a very inconsistent track record. From the lows of Last Stand (2006)\, Apocalypse (2016) and Dark Phoenix (2019) to the highs of X-Men (2000) and X2 (2004) and the wonderful rebound with First Class (2011) and Days of Future Past (2014). Needless to say\, it's very variable\, and often can be either: disappointing or extremely satisfying. Not many series have a reputation like X-Men\, and unfortunately\, many franchise seem to be more vaunted than them\, as if their reputation is somehow superior. I get it\, X-Men has some lows\, meaning the overall quality is inconsistent\, but Logan (2017) is that long-standing film that continues to show case the heights this series can achieve\, especially against the overrated and craptastic MCU. And with that said\, the X-Men films have had their own sequel within the franchise\, obviously The Wolverine trilogy. (A series of which I've seen the 2 most latest but skipped the travesty\, that I hear\, is Origins). With that said\, James Mangold is one of the most underrated directors of his generation\, a director whose prowess has grown and matured over the years. What he achieved here with The Wolverine (2013) is yet to be matched\, or that's what I originally thought. But Mangold managed to help keep the franchise alive by delivering 2 massive hits and well received films. I won't go over the plot\, why should I? You watched it\, right? I digress. Logan itself is why many fans have claimed\, 'this is the Wolverine film I've wanted since I was a kid.' It's gory\, it's violent and yet surprisingly somber and sweet. It's a patient film and it somehow brings out yet more of the political allegory that the series is praised for and keeps it fresh\, yet more haunting now than ever. It's a remarkable adult film that is well needed in our times. The setting into the future is a superb choice\, the opening too goes hand-and-hand to create a setting of hopeless dread. As a fellow cinemaphile\, I was surprised with the opening credits; very rare for modern storytelling. The feeling alone\, with it's black credits allow us (the watchers) to understand that the story being told is gonna be unlike any other in the series - which it is and the music by Marco Beltrami too world effectively. Where 'The Wolverine' setting was bright\, refreshing and filled with Character\, 'Logan' is polar opposite - another credit to Mangold for pulling off two vastly different films. Logan's plot is one long journey that truly captures the feeling with panache. As far as genre conventions go\, it's obvious with the setting to Logan himself admitting he's poisoned that the hero's journey is all but gonna come to an end. But you'd be a damn fool to think the film is gonna be cheap and sentimental\, or think the buoying of Jackman won't help keep the film afloat (luckily\, it's good enough without him; he's just an added bonus). But from the death of Charles\, to the revelation of the government experimentation and the sub-plot to the farm helps the story have a lot more human emotions. The father-daughter story is also very abnormal in execution for the majority of the run time\, yet the ending is bitter sweet and fitting. Also\, the showcasing of the X-Men being showcased in the comics shows truly a great perspective to these characters; homogenized and degraded to being sold out as marketing. Where their struggles are nothing to us\, but everything to them - truly a genius and unpredictable convention that I have not seen since Unbreakable (2000). As the film progresses\, the plot slowly reveals\, each encounter thrillingly unpredictable\, violent and not for the faint of heart. Either escaping from goons\, to Charles' mind freezing everyone\, to the attack on the farm\, 'Logan' fires on all cylinders. The plot threads are genius\, and the pacing fitting. Everything established from the beginning comes to aid everything else in the film. Jackman's performance is distraught\, angry and agitated\, yet never felt overbearing and felt just right in contempt. All of which is fitting and shows in the action - or should I say violence. I've always distinguished that action\, is the easy accessibility to the masses while violence\, often more poetic\, is (often) grounded in realism or excessive to the point of being a fetish (like Tarantino\, Bava and Refn). But in the end\, the 'action' is superb\, and definitely a step-up from The Wolverine. Along with the best elements of The Wolverine and the X-Men aspects of Logan have been brought to this finale\, creating an ending usually unachievable. Logan is one of the grandest achievements for a bloated\, dying genre that continues to discourage artistry and pure\, unadulterated visions. Ending one of the greatest characters in cinema in fine\, poetic form\, to compelling storytelling\, grounded in reality to resonating themes of the evils of what human atrocity can commit. Mangold's Magnum Opus is a masterpiece; a hard-hitting\, stressful journey that truly resonates long after watching. Barley below Days of Future Past for me\, but other than a few quarrels that happen in the film; not worth bringing up\, Logan is exceptional\, like the films that came in 2017.",True,0.8396286368370056,0.8041228652000427,0.7921929359436035,0.8454244136810303,0.8090572357177734,0.8300736546516418,0.7559598088264465,0.8516495227813721,0.8042116165161133

180602,Logan,2017-03-06,4,"Third outing in the Wolverine spine-off franchise\, Logan feels and look Very different from any other X-Men movies out there. J. Mangold and H. Jackman have created a western type of film with mutant in it. Some will dislike the change of sets and tone while others will probably salute the change and enjoy the film for what it is. Delving deeper into themes such as fatherhood\, love\, acceptance\, forgiveness and friendship\, the film holds at heart an obvious dichotomie between Charles and Logan. In this new chapter of their reckless adventures\, they appear like a father and son on the run\, incapable of fully understand one another until a little girl appears and starts to melt the heart of our furious and angry hero who's clearly at the end of his rope. The film reminded me of a few western classics in which the lonely hero has to team up with a few unlikely protagonists to save the day. Mangold has flair and a knack for appropriating himself the story and turn it into something very special and unique for the big screen. Fans of the franchise may be a little unsettled by these changes of plots\, twists\, camera angles and various natural locations. The mostly desaturated palette of colors enhance the effects of dust\, heat\, toughness and animality of the characters. Personally i was thrilled to witness all these changes on screen and have the opportunity to see the weaknesses of our favorite hero exposed to the open\, it makes Logan so much more human and approachable. It's interesting how you can really create something different by simply moving around a few pieces of the puzzle and incorporating new elements to move a story forward. It's almost sad that Jackman will not sign on for another episode because if a fourth installment was planed and was going to be as thrilling as this one\, well count me in to go watch it. As it is though\, Logan may be the most heartwarming and emotional super hero film out there to this day. Quite an achievement to make a film of such inventiveness and quality in these days of extreme C.G.I and overall  silliness of Hollywood-super-hero-movies. Definitely a must see this season.",True,0.7288548350334167,0.7117063999176025,0.6052905321121216,0.710943341255188,0.6994843482971191,0.7071918845176697,0.6164565682411194,0.7236126065254211,0.7089423537254333

Feel it\"".\n\nIt's very rare that a X-men (or any superhero movie)\, could be the hardest thing I've ever progress in terms of my thoughts and feelings. Much hard when writing about it. Heck\, I wouldn't even call it a superhero movie\, but a mixture of both western and drama in disguise. No one is safe and the stakes are higher than before. While the villains themselves aren't anything I would call \""great\""\, but they did felt like a real threat and wasn't too cliché to the story.\n\nStill...\n\n\""Logan\"" is one of the best non superhero movies I've seen in awhile. A sad but satisfying farewell to are fan favorite. A surprising character driven movie with real consequences. A bold and risky film that wouldn't have been made years ago in the hands of FOX. But I think it's the unexpected powerhouse that got me in many ways. Something the previous movies couldn't do.\n\nMuch darker and gruesome than I expected. Remember in \""X-men: Apocalypse\"" when Wolverine goes on a full rampage and violently kills all the guards\, but most of it was off-screen\, even through you can clearly see blood on the walls. Well take that scene and imagine actually seeing him tearing through people. Yeah\, it really goes for it and that ain't a bad thing.\n\nHugh Jackman has portrayed Wolverine for over seventeen years and this is by far his most powerful performance. It's the humanity and the depression of the character we never truly seen. Despite happening around him\, Logan's true enemy is himself. Before the end of an era\, he learns the meaning of family and being a hero for others. I know this may sound far-fetch\, but I would go as far to say that Jackman deserves some award buzz for this. The raw emotion he brought to his scenes without any sloppy music under neath it\, is achievement. Jackman will forever be Wolverine and nothing will top that.\n\nPatrick Stewart delivers his last and most heartfelt performance as Charles Xavier. In this movie\, he isn't the same Professor X who know and love. He is 90 year old\, suffers from dementia\, and has a dirty mouth. But at the same time\, he's the a father figure to Logan. The scenes between Stewart and Jackman are one of the few highlights of the film.\n\nDafne Keen was fantastic as Laura/X-23. She captures the characters inner emotions just by her facial expressions that says so much than dialogue. What's more impressive that this is her first major role and already I'm interested of what she dose next.\n\nI have to give major credit to James Mangold for what he brings to this harsh\, but beautiful film. I wouldn't say he's an absolute professional when it comes to action scenes and story\, but the perfect balance of brutal and bleakness he brought to those scenes was freaking spot on. The Wolverine series have been all over the place in terms of quality and tone\, but Mangold finally puts it on his feet. By giving me what I wanted for years and much more.\n\nOverall rating: \""Logan\"" is a special kind of ride that hits you in places you wouldn't expect. I grinned and cried at the right moments. And that last shot was just perfect. \n\nFarewell bub.",True,0.7773217558860779,0.7949722409248352,0.6536911129951477,0.8087294101715088,0.603084146976471,0.7847622632980347,0.7256871461868286,0.7971795797348022,0.795956552028656

187382,Logan,2017-02-22,5,"(This review contains spoilers) \n\nLogan is a fantastic return to form for the X-Men series and a perfect climax for such a landmark saga of superhero action that has managed to thrill and intrigue audiences for 17 years now. It's remarkably humbling almost to see the saga succumb to almost mindless swearing and a steep decline to an angsty\, mid-life crisis type of warbling that leaves a mark on the mind long after the film has ended. There's definitely messages in the film\, some that hit and unfortunately some that miss their mark\, however the point of the film is completely acknowledged throughout - everyone's favourite claw-bearing mutant is dying and won't be around forever. The film resonates with the Harry Potter series\, reminding us all of when Dumbledore died and an audience of film fanatics were forced to grow up. Unfortunately\, Professor Xavier's demise is short-mourned\, possibly because we have already endured this during Brett Ratner's 2006 portion of the story in The Last Stand\, when Xavier had the tearful goodbye that he deserved. It's sad to see Xavier buried in an unmarked grave in the forest as he is such a monumental part of the story\, however this film is definitely not an X-Men film\, it is a Wolverine film and regardless\, is a perfect conclusion to his grittier stream of stories. Hugh Jackman really deserves an oscar nod for his performance in this film and even the unknown Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 undeniably deserves recognition for her amazing portrayal as the mute mutant daughter of Logan. The characters are not superheroes in this\, they are victims and their powers are put last\, their characters first and this is so refreshing to see. James Mangold's direction is fantastic\, bold and solid all throughout the film. It's also refreshing to see a villain who without powers of any kind\, manages to be more terrifying and gigantic in his villainy than \""immortal\, god-like\"" Apocalypse could ever dream of being. This really highlights the importance of good writing. A well done to everyone involved is highly deserved in bringing this saga to a close.",True,0.1622605174779892,0.1636904776096344,0.07705793529748917,0.14302843809127808,0.12007898837327957,0.15884046256542206,0.13302455842494965,0.13778704404830933,0.10584113746881485
187395,Logan,2017-10-25,5,"This review of \""Logan\"" contains some spoilers.\n\nAfter 17 years of playing the character of Wolverine in various X-Men films from Fox studios\, Hugh Jackman is finally hanging up the claws with the film\, \""Logan\"". The good thing about this is that Hugh Jackman is leaving the character on a very high note. It is easy to say that this is the best movie in the X-Men franchise as the majority of their films are pretty easy to top. So instead I will say that this could very well be one of the best superhero films overall.\n\n\""Logan\"" takes place in one of the various X-Men timelines in the year 2029\, where there have been no new mutants born in the last 25 years. A weary Logan (Hugh Jackman) tries to lay low as a chauffeur while trying to care for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart). It is an interesting concept to see these characters\, who were once protecting the world and their mutant kind from annihilation withered down mentally and physically. There is no fancy mansion to live in and the rest of the X-Men are gone. Logan has suffered throughout his lifetime as he has lost people close to him. Now\, his mutant healing power is failing him as his body is being poisoned by the adamantium covering his skeleton. At the same time\, he cares for Professor Xavier\, one of the most powerful mutants alive\, who is now old and suffering from a brain disease and seizures which\, when they hit\, cause people within a surrounding area to go into a comatose state. The goal is to get enough money for a boat and\, along with their pale mutant friend Caliban (Stephen Merchant)\, get away. However\, the plan is cut short when a mutant girl by the name of Laura (Dafne Keen)\, enters their lives. Now Logan falls into everything he was trying to escape and must protect the girl from those who are hunting her.\n\nTo have the final Wolverine film release with an R rating turned out to be a good move. The rating helps reflect the grim state these characters are in. For years\, we have seen Wolverine use his claws in various films but never to the level as seen in \""Logan\"". This violence stresses the brutality this man has experienced and has carried with him for the hundreds of years that he has been alive. When Logan cuts loose and kills with his claws it is up close\, and not pretty. This has been his life all these years. But the violence is not only towards Logan's enemies but appears on Logan as well as his healing power has slowed down and we see some of the scars and wounds he's endured. The violence in the film is not thrown in for violence sake\, when it happens there is a reason\, and it moves the character and the story along.\n\nThe performances from the lead actors in this film are outstanding. I think Hugh Jackman has given his best performance since \""Prisoners\"". The emotional baggage Logan carries throughout the film is present in Jackman's watery eyes and his display of emotion is heartfelt. It is a performance that I could see as a nod for Oscar nomination. The same goes for Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. There are moments where Patrick Stewart bounces between the Professor we once knew in previous films to the ill-minded elderly man now reliant on drugs to prevent him from harming others\, which is performed impeccably well. Also\, there is a scene where Charles talks about finally having a perfect night and then opens up to Logan about the past and how he does not deserve it\, which is a shining emotional moment. Finally\, I don't know where James Mangold found Dafne Keen to play Laura but oh what a find she was. She was great as the mini-Wolverine and her action scenes were stunning. She delivers a ferocity that matches that of Hugh Jackman's and also manages to bring an audience to tears.\n\nThe chemistry between the three leads is tremendous. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are already familiar with one another\, playing the same characters in films past\, but this time it is different. Their characters are weary and broken\, yet their relationship is stronger than ever and it shows in the performances. There are many great moments on the road trip which bring a smile to my face hearing the two bicker about\, and also moments of eventual tears. Despite not having a lot to say\, Dafne Keen manages to fit right in with the two actors as the film progresses and even more so in the third act.\n\nFor the villains\, the standout is Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce\, the leader of the militant Reavers group who is sent to retrieve Laura. The character truly shines in the first half of the film\, being one who is a big fan of Wolverine\, but Wolverine is in the way of what he wants. Though by the time film reaches the third act\, the character is brushed aside to make room for another villain who is a reflection of Logan's past self.\n\nJames Mangold's film is a modern western and he is not afraid to have the film wear its influences on its sleeves. There are a number of influences which include \""Children of Men\"" and \""Unforgiven\""\, however\, the one that is most clear is the influence from the 1953 western\, \""Shane\"". The story of a gunfighter who tries to escape from his past by falling in with a family is similar to Logan's story. There is actually a mini \""Shane\"" moment in the film when Logan and company come unto a family that Logan ends up helping\, though the outcome is not quite the same. Also\, the film\, \""Shane\"" is played on a television at one point in the film and the famous \""There's no living with a killing\"" quote is spoken as well.\n\nThe mini \""Shane\"" scene is actually a golden moment for me as it was great to see Logan and company settle for a bit\, enjoy each other's company\, and just be like a family for that brief amount of time. It was a moment to cherish as you can feel the enjoyment they are having and I wish there could be more moments like this one. Kudos to the writers James Mangold\, Scott Frank and Michael Green on scripting something as wonderful as this much needed moment. As a matter of fact\, the script and overall execution of the film is done so well that I truly feel it is not necessary to even see the previous films in the series. Like the title of the film being\, \""Logan\""\, it pushes away from being seen as a sequel and stands on its own from the rest.\n\nWhen the trailer for \""Logan\"" hit\, I was surprised at how well done the trailer was and\, though I really liked the trailer\, I was trying to keep my expectations from getting too high. The track record for the films in the X-Men franchise is not a good one. However\, \""Logan\"" proved that when a studio allows a director to take a risk and deliver a film as soulful and different than what's been released previously in the franchise\, it is a risk worth taking.

188709,Logan,2017-03-30,4,"Though it has flaws deep at its core\, Logan is a step in the right direction within the superhero genre.\n\nThe film presents us two gods whose biology is failing them. The greatest mind on Earth\, Charles Xavier\, is suffering from a degenerative brain disease\, and seemingly immortal Logan's body is failing him. It's a great set up and the relationship between the two characters is compelling. The two of them escort and protect the young mutant Laura. The film focuses on Logan's and Laura's relationship and how they bond\, though every time its cuts away from a Charles-Logan scene to Laura\, I was disappointed. The first act of the film is fantastic\, promising. It sets the stage for a drama that happens to have super humans in it\, rather than it being a superhero film. But once Laura shows up and the action starts\, it strays away from that\, succumbing to the genre it is 'supposed' to be.\n\nLogan is well-structured - dramatic beats happen at the right times\, side-characters are introduced at the right times. It is all very much by the book\, but in a good way. However\, the emotional moments fall flat. Perhaps it is due to the poor writing. There are plenty of good jokes and quips\, but a lot of the dialogue is too on the nose. There is no subtext (or the writers confused subtext with characters talking vaguely about past events). However\, I think the reason the moments fall flat\, is the inherent contradiction in the film - Logan tries to tell a story about the horrors of violence\, yet ends up glorifying it.\n\nI'll admit\, that I am more adverse to violence than the average person. That does not mean that I don't think there is a place for it in art. Battle Royale and Tarantino films have ridiculous violence which is hilarious\, films like A Clockwork Orange and American Psycho show the violent worlds and headspaces the lead characters inhabit\, Snowpiercer and most war films use to show how horrible it is\, and some movies\, like The Matrix have awesome action spectacle. Logan tries to combine the message of war films with the spectacle of action films. It doesn't make sense.\n\nOne thing that is important to keep in mind when critiquing film is to not review the movie based on what it could've been\, but rather to look at it for what it is. For example\, Liar\, Liar\, has an interesting premise about a man physically unable to lie. Criticizing the film for not delving into the philosophy of objective and universal truths is not fair to the film\, because Liar\, Liar is trying to be a fun family comedy and should be reviewed through that lens. So criticizing Logan for having action movie violence might not be fair\, but since its story tries to contradict itself - it hints throughout at a more profound film that could've been - I think it is fair in this case.\n\nLogan\, the Wolverine\, has always faced his problems with his claws out\, but as his body deteriorates\, it becomes less of an option. He tries to avoid fighting\, but trouble seems to find and him and violence only begets more violence. This is the message set up through the beginning of the film. Logan even tries to raise Laura right and not solve all her problems violently. All this should add up to a wonderful\, introspective film\, yet what we get is one where the audience cheers as nameless henchmen #152 is stabbed in the face and blood splatters everywhere. The thoughtful poignant message is sprinkled so sparingly that it is overwhelmed by all the action.\n\nOne criticism I have of the Marvel films is the fact that due to the PG13 rating\, the violence has no impact\, it's a bunch of dudes jumping off screen wildly as they spin in the air. However\, the way Logan utilizes its creative freedom with the R-rating is suboptimal. The film starts with dismemberment and blood flinging everywhere. There is nowhere left to go after that point. Each fight sequence is just one bloody spectacle after another. There are so many close ups of faces getting stabbed\, that it stops eliciting a response; there is diminished impact as the film goes on. It also doesn't help that the people being murdered left and right are nameless\, faceless (most of them wear a helmet/mask combo) soldiers. Snowpiercer is a violent film throughout\, but once the tunnel fight sequences happens\, it is so much more extreme\, so much more brutal\, that you remember it. It built to it. Snowpiercer also showed the harrowing aftermath\, people mourning and the audience is also left with people to mourn. What you're left with after each action sequence in Logan\, or at least what you're supposed to\, is an adrenaline rush and excitement.\n\nLogan is still a good film\, despite this issue; it is well put together and well-acted. It has more of a soul and character than Dr. Strange\, the most recent Marvel film. Just like Nolan Batman trilogy was a refreshing departure from the campy superhero films of the early 2000s\, Logan offers a different experience than the formulaic Marvel films.  Though I don't think it will have the long-lasting cultural impact like The Dark Knight\, I do hope it does start a new trend in 'superhero movies' or\, hopefully\, 'movies that have superheroes in them'.",True,0.6187575459480286,0.6495709419250488,0.5038062334060669,0.6302515268325806,0.5785855650901794,0.5767266750335693,0.547508716583252,0.6327813267707825,0.6525991559028625

189788,Logan,2018-05-10,3,"To summarize\, I quite liked the beginning of this movie but it didn't really materialize into a cohesive story. It set the scene of the desert well\, and presents a grim picture of the mutant situation in the near future. Speaking of \""near future\""\, this is not the only \""meta\"" tie-in since the film also features X-men comic books as a motif. The story is still flowing well when the main villain is introduced along with the premise for the conflict. However it was during the first big action scene that I started to lose my sense of immersion. The main reason was excess brutality/evil-ness. To be clear\, I don't have a problem with violence in all cases. Actually\, I really enjoyed a lot of the acrobatic combat - the claws through the head\, somersaults\, and all that. That kind of violece is justified by the story - war is war\, and it's more about flawless execution than moral quandries. It's those situations that prompt the viewer to think \""why would they do that? it's so evil\"" that bother me. Even those parts aren't necessarily bad\, for example I thought the scene showing the kids in the laboratory was quite effective\, because the violece was implied and imagined. Even if it's only implied\, though\, the violence itself isn't the plot - it's only a means to an end. What I mean by that is that the viewer can usually assume there's some reason behind the violence - some tricky moral question that we end up asking outselves. That way we as viewers resound with the characters as they respond to these same questions. However\, in Logan\, this 'bigger picture' is often missing. We're repeatedly showing evil characters doing evil things\, but don't really get any reason to give them sympathy. Also\, the plot in the later part of the movie is a little eye-roll inducing ... the whole 'passing on to the next generation' thing is just a little too obvious\, and suddently the protagonists are kids who are definitely not old enough to watch a rated R movie - why?",True,0.4511323869228363,0.34338095784187317,0.07085337489843369,0.18488876521587372,0.1260761022567749,0.10154657810926437,0.179940864443779,0.2881324589252472,0.468405157327652

193241,Logan,2017-03-27,4,"WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD. Challenges the conventions of the genre but not necessarily in a good way. As an old school comics superhero fan\, this crossed a few lines too many for me. I grew up at a time when superheroes were unabashedly heroic - there was none of the dark soul-searching\, morally ambiguous vigilantism\, or evading capture by the cops while snagging the bad guys. There was also very little blood and even less killing. Superheroes used secret identities in order to protect their allies and loved ones\, not themselves.\n\nI'm generally okay with the more modern form\, and certainly Wolverine was one of the earliest characters to break the old mold\, being a character who from the start was conceived as being as much a wild animal as human. Still\, I'm not willing to go all the way with a superhero who's become a broken down alcoholic limo driver who's perfectly fine with walking away from a little girl about to be captured and murdered by a whole battalion of psychopathic mercenaries. I didn't need to see a helpless\, senile Charles Xavier being dropped into a grimy road stop lavatory stall like a sack of wet manure. I'm not okay with my superheroes ending up brutally murdered and left in shallow graves in the middle of nowhere. To me this takes the \""Dark Knight\"" model to a grim\, sordid extreme that left me depressed and angry. I doubt that's what the film makers intended. At least I hope not.\n\nIt's a well-made movie to be sure\, and if the characters were mere humans new to my acquaintance instead of long-beloved superheroes\, I probably would have enjoyed it just fine. But I happen to think that storytellers\, and particularly tellers of stories with long histories and rich lore\, have a responsibility to respect the unspoken covenant with the audience that tradition implies and not go hog wild with wreaking havoc on our expectations and loyalties. I felt that this film treats Wolverine and Charles Xavier with far less dignity and respect than they deserve. Maybe it's just me\, but like I said\, I'm old school. \n\nI didn't hate the movie\, but I would have preferred to see the last of the original race of mutants come to a somewhat less ignoble end.",True,0.8462170958518982,0.8260409235954285,0.8103784322738647,0.8660290241241455,0.8099626898765564,0.8453717827796936,0.847687840461731,0.8326671123504639,0.8471245169639587

194425,Logan,2017-03-05,5,"well as promised\, i will do a review of Logan but i decided to make it 2 parts. the first part will be a non spoiler review\, and the second will contain spoilers ( however i will probably see Logan a second time before i post that one).. and i was gonna make this into just a video post but i changed my mind and decided just to type this while in my boxers.Regardless i hope you enjoy.\n\n   Anyways\, as you could already tell i was so hyped about this movie before it even came out. i watched the trailer about 20+ times double checking for any easter eggs\, and then looking up the comics they used for the storylines. The Excitement was real for this one\, especially when i found out it was being directed by James Mangold and produced by Scott Franks\, because i knew they worked on the last wolverine together and that turned out well so it raised the level for this movie. However i tell you this\, i was not prepared for what i watched...i cannot express all the emotions that i felt through this movie. Not even just from a comic/superhero fan\, but from a movie fan\, this was a superb film. Movies follow a pretty standard template\, and try to hit all the marks along the way with the scenes they produce. with this film i feel this one hit bullseye with all of them. \n\n   To start\, the acting in this is great all around. I mean Hugh Jackman has been wolverine for 17 years now and starred in 10 movies as Logan. At this point its just hard to see anyone else play the character the way hugh Jackman does\, and never have we gotten a poor performance from the man. Patrick Stewart is practically the same in the sense that he has played the role of Professer Xaiver\, ever since X-Men back in 2000 and has been fantastic ever since. Not to mention Patrick Stewart lost 21 lbs to play the role of the old and sick professor xaiver\, talk about dedication. Even the roles of smaller characters that they meet along the way or all the child actors such as Dafne Keen\, were amazing even when she was going ape shit on all the bad guys. it was an all around great performance from everyone in the film\, and you can understand why both Hugh Jackman\, and Patrick Stewart both wanted this to be their last film as X-Men. \n\n    Next\, i would give a shoutout to the Make-up/editing/cgi crew because their work on this movie was impeccable. From the blades going through people to just the scars on wolverine. All of it looked so real you almost forget that CGI is a thing. they even did some other cool stuff that i cant acknowledge in this review because it would give away some story but it was some great work. the editing and makup crew honestly make a movie come alive\, if someone gets hurt\, you can visual see it which almost makes it hurt for you too. For some that might not be what they want\, but i think it enhances the movie because when you see Logan limping around with all the scars on him looking beat to shit\, you really feel that..you want him to be the Wolverine he was back in 2000\, but you can really tell he is an Old man Logan\, while that may have partial to do with the acting the make up helps fill in all the gaps. Overall\, you couldnt ask for a better visual performance of what a rated R Logan should be. Tagging on with the Make-up and Editing i would add on that while\, you dont focus so much on the production Design/ photography or the background it really helps build in some story. They add subtle things that really help the  movie goer see that its 2029/ futuristic\, but it still has that look of the normality of society today. i enjoyed the scenery in this film and it didnt even have sell me on it\, like most of these  space films do. They didn't need anything big to get the attention\, because a simple picture of Logan standing with X-23 or something similar will do it for me.\n\n   Lastly\, the Writing/ Storyline on this was fantastic. They sort of followed these main 3 comic book stories\, but switched them up a little ( i would say which 3 but that would ruin the movie for some). Great acting and fancy visuals are always nice to have however\, most would say the storyline is the most important part to any film. So while i can't dig super deep into what all happens in the movie since this is a non-spoiler review\, i will say this film has got everything a movie needs. I was shocked\, i laughed\, i had a constant smile\, i cried (literally) and i was absolutely blown away. You get Comedy\, you get Action (ALOT)\, and you get parts that tug on your heart strings. i would say about half the people watching\, if they have a heart\, they either teared up or actually shed some tears. Logan had it all and its the movie that Wolverine deserved and that almost anyone can enjoy (minus the kids).\n\n   Now i know what you're thinking..but Ethan what about the Cons to this movie?! I really couldnt find too much wrong with this movie...i might have something to talk about after i see it for a second time\, but as of right now the only 2 things that i see wrong is that 1.) it is violent so the kids wont be able to see it unless you just don't care\, but if they are a wolverine fan and they were hoping for another Pg-13 X-Men movie I'm sorry. 2.) After watching this movie you want more. More Wolverine\, More X-men\, all of it but the sad part is..the rest of the X-men movies just don't compare...the closest you can get would either be X-Men: Days of Future Past or The Wolverine other than those...but even that transition isnt the same as this movie..so this movie is as satisfied as you get and that sucks because this movie is the end of an Era.\nif you want an official number rating ...5/5....10/10...100%.\n\nThanks for reading my review\, i recommend this movie to anyone looking for entertainment or something to do and if you think i should do this more often just leave a like and comment.",True,0.05033443868160248,0.03967888280749321,0.0472501665353775,0.04297161474823952,0.04490511491894722,0.04773760959506035,0.04746215045452118,0.0410231314599514,0.039909034967422485

194879,Logan,2017-02-17,5,"We've reached the end of an era.\n\nLogan\, the final time we'll see Hugh Jackman don the adamantium claws\, has been released to theaters. Seventeen years and 9 movies is a long time for an actor to remain in one role\, and it was inevitable that one day Jackman would move on. When you play a character that doesn't age\, eventually time starts to catch up to you\, and it's not exactly helped by the health challenges Jackman faced\, including a demanding fitness and dietary regimen\, and repeated bouts of skin cancer. So it was that Jackman announced that this film would be his last. The end of 17 years as one of the anchors of the franchise\, and for many people he was the definitive Wolverine. He may have been taller and handsomer than his comics counterpart\, but few people now can imagine anyone who can embody the feral rage of James \""Logan\"" Howlett better.\n\nDirected by James Mangold\, who also helmed the last outing of the ol' Canucklehead\, Logan arrived on the heels of the divisive X-Men: Apocalypse\, in a franchise that's had almost as many misses as it's had hits. Which in part is why so many people were sad to learn that this would be his last ride. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has been one of the few universally positive aspects of the X-Men film franchise\, and with the departure of another franchise stalwart\, Patrick Stewart\, the film series faces an even more uncertain future than the X-Men themselves at the prospect of the new timeline that began with the critically-acclaimed Days of Future Past. Despite the success of 2016's Deadpool\, the middling response to Apocalypse left the series in desperate need of a home run\, even as it geared up for a massive expansion. The Gambit solo film is apparently back on track\, X-Force is looming on the horizon\, New Mutants is already beginning preproduction\, and both Deadpool 2 and the next core X-Men film (currently code-named Supernova and rumored to bring a fresh take to the Phoenix Saga after the ill-conceived X-Men: The Last Stand) are expected to join it in filming for a 2018 release.\n\nLogan doesn't just knock it out of the park. It clears the bases.\n\nSet in 2029\, 6 years following the new future glimpsed at the end of Days of Future Past\, the film finds the world has radically changed. Mutants have all but disappeared\, and the X-Men are gone. Logan finds himself driving a limo for hire while caring for an aging and ailing Charles Xavier in Juarez\, Mexico\, aided only by the ex-black marketeer and information broker Caliban (Stephen Merchant\, taking over for Tómas Lemarquis' portrayal in Apocalypse). Logan's hope is to save up enough money to buy a boat\, and take Charles away from Juarez. While on a job driving for a funeral\, Logan is approached by a woman named Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez)\, desperately seeking the Wolverine for help. After initially rebuffing her\, he later reconsiders when she offers him $50\,000 to take her and her daughter\, Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen) to North Dakota. But not all is what it seems\, and Logan soon finds himself on the bad side of Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook)\, head of security for the Alkali Transigen corporation under Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant).\n\nThe story itself is adapted primarily from the famed Old Man Logan storyline by Mark Millar\, with significant elements drawn from Christopher Yost and Craig Kyle's X-23: Innocence Lost\, as well as a third that would be too much of a spoiler to even name here. It also draws extensive influence from classics of the Western genre such as Unforgiven\, Shane\, and The Cowboys (one scene even features Charles and Laura sitting down to watch Shane while Logan sees about transportation)\, and many similar themes are explored within the film. Logan and Charles are fading vestiges of another age - Logan's mutant ability to heal is failing\, while Charles suffers from a degenerative mental illness. The film is rated R for its violence\, and it thoroughly earns it as we finally get to see the Wolverine unleashed. Fight scenes are visceral and bloody\, and the camera is not shy of showing just how ugly a man with three\, foot-long claws in each hand can be in a fight. It's gruesome\, but the sort of gruesome that long-time fans of the character and the series have been desperate to finally see realized. This brutality extends to the fight choreography\, as well. There's no over-choreographed battle ballet\, here. Logan is vicious and ugly\, and when he goes to fight it's murder. With only a handful of mutants who even appear in the film there's very little in the way of variety of superpowers\, allowing Mangold's direction to focus on showing us why Logan is the best there is at what he does. Although running a hefty 2h 21mins\, the film never really seems to drag\, as the viewer is kept engaged by the deep character drama driving the plot between action scenes. Logan and Charles bicker and argue like father and son\, while both struggle to handle the virtually mute Laura\, and its these character interactions that truly drive the film\, exemplified with a quiet moment where Charles begs Logan to remember that life is people who love each other\, and that he still has time for it.\n\nThe performances all around are perfection. Jackman builds on the jaded cynicism Logan displayed in 2013's The Wolverine\, infusing him with a deep weariness\, and one really feels the weight of Logan's 200 years bearing him down as the film progresses. His rage and frustration are palpable\, and as the film builds to the climax hearing the feral howl of the Wolverine being fully unleashed one last time will send a chill down your spine. Stewart also stands out for his performance as Charles Xavier. Although controversy has surrounded Fox's casting decisions from the very first movie (Jackman himself was called out as too pretty and tall for the famously short and ugly Logan\, and his unknown quality at the time had many doubting his ability)\, you won't find an X-Men fan who would have even considered disagreeing with the casting of Stewart as Professor X. Stewart really gets to demonstrate his range in this film\, as Charles wobbles between manic dementia and wizened sage in such a way that you're never quite sure whether he's truly gone mad\, or if he knows more than he's letting on. It's a very different Xavier than we've seen before\, taking McAvoy's broken junky from Days of Future Past and ratcheting it up to 11\, in a way that only Patrick Stewart could pull off. He's often crass and foul-mouthed\, but the moment he meets Laura slips readily right back into his role as the Professor\, showing her great grandfatherly affection in a performance fully deserving of a Supporting Actor nomination. Meanwhile Boyd Holbrook fills Donald Pierce with smarmy charisma as he picks bits of scenery from his teeth with one cybernetic hand\, and Richard E. Grant's Zander Rice pursues Logan\, Charles\, and Laura with cold sociopathy.\n\nHowever the film's real standout performance is by 11 year-old newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura\, whom comic book fans know as X-23. The daughter of an actor father and actress mother\, Keen brings a feral\, predatory edge to the role. She's at once both dangerous and disarming\, and perfectly sells the surface impression that she's just a harmless child. Despite not having a line of dialogue that isn't a grunt or wordless scream prior to the halfway point\, Keen gives Laura a remarkable and natural emotional depth. It's tangible in the look of wonder in her eyes when she sees the lights of a city for the first time\, and she speaks volumes with the smallest smile. This is a girl to watch closely as she grows into her craft; even now she delivers an award-worthy performance in only her first big-screen credit (and second overall\, her only prior credit being an appearance in The Refugees) and she's only going to get better as time goes by. That she manages to stand above the performances of even such veterans of the craft as Jackman\, and particularly the legendary Stewart\, is testament to her natural affinity for acting\, and both actors and director Mangold have taken every opportunity to praise her work ethic and talent.\n\nLogan is a hard movie. It's brutally violent\, raw\, yet possessing of a deep sentimental melancholy\, and stands apart from the other films in the genre. This is not just the best film in the X-Men franchise\, but perhaps the best film in its entire genre. It's a beautiful\, loving deconstruction of the superhero film\, and a moving swan song for one of the architects of the modern superhero movie.",True,0.5397568345069885,0.5024654269218445,0.5141440629959106,0.541327714920044,0.5338961482048035,0.5431622266769409,0.4937584698200226,0.5435343980789185,0.49881866574287415

195490,Logan,2017-05-26,2,"What a very crappy ending to\, overall\, a pretty good series run of films. We don't learn anything new in this film\, Except for this: a lioness uses claws on her hind paws for defense. \n\nJust like Batman/Superman and King Arthur\, I found this film emotionless. There were no stakes. There was a lot of yelling\, for no apparent reason other than \""I'm kicking you\"" or \""I'm stabbing you\""\, and ultimately\, this movie moved the needle nowhere and is not a film that will survive two or three decades like some of its predecessors.\n\nI have a real problem with this film having literally no continuity with pretty much any of the others. A general rule in these movies\, in all movies really\, is to have a character arc where the character CHANGES. Of course\, Logan has changed and does much changing over these previous installments. One of those changes is that he quits his drinking\, vagabond existence. But\, as we start this film\, he is back on the sauce\, and it is killing him. So\, I guess those previous changes in character didn't stick. So\, he ends up reluctantly taking care of Dr. X and an albino. That would have been a better title. Because every thing that comes after that set-up in this movie is pretty useless. \n\nThe whole angle of the daughter? She was grown in a test tube. When it would have been far more interesting to USE narrative of the 2000 film and actually have the daughter be of NATURAL BIRTH like all the original X-Men were. You could even use a 16-17 year old actress instead of a 9 year old who plays most of the movie as a mute. Think about it. In those days of 1999 and 2000\, Logan was traveling around\, cage fighting\, drinking heavily...he could have knocked some woman up. It's possible. And it would have been far more interesting. But\, Hollywood has to keep evil military research goons as the bane of all the worlds problems. This approach has been used so much it's gone beyond cliche. It's old. It's tired. It's dead. \n\nJust like this film.

195703,Logan,2017-11-19,5,"What happens when superheroes get old is the main and interesting question this movie answers. It's a question when you think of when you place superheroes in the real world. Logan is a great movie and I think one of the best superhero movies ever made. The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script\, the action\, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch\, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film\, highly recommended.This is a wolverine movie aimed at adults and definitely not for small children. The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of himself. Logan\, himself is now older and his health is slowly deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story\, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys\, but one that is on a more human level. \""Logan\""\, is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family\, loyalty\, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.\n\nThis is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine. It is the movie he and director\, James Mangold had always wanted to make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans\, has plenty of action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.\n\nA MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR ANYONE!!\n\nWas the above review useful to you?  Yes No\n114 out of 200 people found the following review useful:\n\nCrap with a Capital K!\n1/10\nAuthor: masonj-1 from USA\n19 March 2017\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nWarning Warning Warning Warning The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!!\n\n-------------------- This review contains spoilers RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING --------- ---\n\nA completely morbid and joyless film. Grim and hopeless to the point to depravity! The ignominious death fashioned for Charles Xavier is unworthy -- given the legacy of this character. \n\nEqually distasteful are the not so subtle suggestions that this film or its characters are comparable to Shane. This self-service association is entirely unearned and borders on heresy. You could have done so much better with a modicum of imagination and heart. \n\nWhen I saw the coming attractions it left me feeling miserable. I though \""Who would possible want to see such a grim and hopeless film?\"". As an owner of copies of the previous two films and most X-men movies\, I went to see it anyway. I left the theater feeling even worse than I did after viewing the coming attractions.\n\nThe rating of 3 out of 10 rather than 2 out of 10 is for the visceral depiction of the effects of Professor X's 'brainstorm' That part was very well done\n\nAside from that\, thanks for nothing guys. Eat soup and cough.In  a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time- and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside due to their fresh take on the genre)\, it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully- executed as 'Logan' is made. I mean let's face it\, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.\n\nI understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously\, such as they have tried with the Avengers films\, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously\, and pulls it off with such precision\, as they did here in 'Logan'\, a film that focuses more on the \""humane\"" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero\, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X-Men Origins' I'm looking at you).\n\nTwo characters that we've come to know and love\, James \""Wolverine\"" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles \""Professor X\"" Xavier\, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state\, once characters that resembled strength and power\, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching\, adrenaline- pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving\, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy\, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is 'The Wolverine'.\n\nI think it's the uncertainty throughout that gives the film that powerful punch. In the other X-Men films (and most other Marvel films for that)\, we are faced with a plethora of superheroes each fighting a seemingly impossible army\, but no matter what\, there is always a general feeling that the good guys will win\, and this usually happens. So when attending a superhero film\, you sit back in ease\, knowing the protagonists will succeed\, however in 'Logan' that never happens\, there is never that sense of safety\, we can't be certain of their outcomes. Every step of the way\, Wolverine looks tired\, he looks sick\, he's dying gradually\, and due to his weakened form\, we are left worrying for the character\, there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack. This is the harrowing truth throughout\, we are emotionally-concerned from start to finish.\n\nWith utterly stunning cinematography\, a hard-hitting score\, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar- deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date\, a gritty and vulnerable adventure into the vulnerability of superheroes.",True,0.8400330543518066,0.8387331962585449,0.8101324439048767,0.8625947833061218,0.8212754130363464,0.8349210619926453,0.8018031120300293,0.8592977523803711,0.802955687046051
195733,Logan,2017-03-04,5,"WHAT I LIKED: I was expecting Hugh Jackman's last outing as Wolverine to hit me hard\, but nothing could have prepared me for the true impact of 'Logan.' Yes not many film experiences have the entire theatre - myself included - crying their eyes out\, but this thing undoubtedly did. That's not just because it's such a strong and heart-wrenching film in its own right though; I would also argue it's because it's an equally successful tribute to the legacy of the long-running X-Men franchise\, the Wolverine character\, and Hugh Jackman's timeless and perfect protrayal as well.\nIn that regard\, not only is it the most fitting send-off we could have ever hoped for; it also makes you feel a great sense of pride and respect for the hands that have crafted this saga\, as well as an intense sadness in the knowledge that Jackman wont be returning. It just filled me with so much emotion considering how far the franchise and character have come - both in terms of the story of mutants\, and in terms of how far things have come along creatively.\n\nHowever\, Logan isn't a film that relies too much on what's come before\, as it most definitely builds something of strong creative integrity in itself too\, and develops its own emotional moments in the process. In fact it's only these that get you to a place where you can begin thinking about everything that's come before\, and that's the real beauty of it.\nIn its own right though\, Logan is a damn brilliant film\, as James Mangold balances everything extremellly well\, even whilst delivering it all with such a heavy hammer. That's a real talent\, and as a result Logan has an extremelly balanced tone throughout; mixing emotional darkness\, tense excitement and gritty\, dry humour in all the right places. It also uses its R-rating to just the right degree too\, as I feel it helps provide room for some incredible action\, some occasional laughs to lighten the mood\, and to develop Logan and his relationship with Laura further. On that note\, Logan's arc in this film is very upsetting and truly beautiful\, and the ending in particular really got me. Our supporting characters are hardly short of their journeys either as Laura and Professor X (who are both brought to life impecably by their actors) also have very interesting and moving story arcs that are hugely affected by the changed world around them. The world has changed too\, and we can see that thanks to some great world-building and a very well-constructed\, world-influenced plot. It would seem it's a sad future for mutants whichever timeline they're on then\, and that says a whole lot just on its own...\n\nIn the end then\, if this was just a film\, it would be a very emotional\, hard-hitting mix of sadness\, poetic beauty\, great characters and brilliant action. I can't help feeling it's a little more than that though\, as if you're an X-Men or Wolverine fan\, it may also have you feeling a great weight of emotion and respect for the franchise\, the people who've crafted it\, the messages behind it\, and mostly for Hugh Jackman himself. This isn't just a film; it's also a tribute\, and the reality of that hits just as hard as the gritty reality of what's on screen. Bring tissues\, this is incredible.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: I might have liked to have seen a few inklings of the general social standing at this time in the timeline\, but that doesn't really hinder the overall experience for me.\nVERDICT: \""So this is what it feels like...\"" Logan is not only my favourite X-Men movie\, it's also my favourite comic-book movie of all time.

196349,Logan,2016-12-17,5,"Whether it was fans loving the comics back in the day or the X-Men film franchise making good films about superheroes possible\, an R-rated film about the Wolverine was the dream of every die-hard fan\, and thus Logan is born. Playing the character for over 17 years now\, Hugh Jackman is one of the longest running men to portray a superhero on the big screen. Make no mistake here\, this will be his final film based on this particular character. In many more ways than one\, this is a spectacularly executed superhero film\, but it's also the most grounded\, raw\, and most honest in the entire X-Men film franchise. Isolating itself from the rest of the franchise\, this film brings closure to many things and it just may be my favourite film to every display this character on-screen. Here are my thoughts on why I believe Logan is a terrific film. \n\nAt its core\, Logan is a simple story about how mutants in the year 2029 have almost gone extinct. Logan and Charles Xavier are the last two remaining mutants\, who are also growing old and frail\, losing some of their abilities. Coming across a young girl with special abilities\, Logan very quickly delves into her character\, making this sort of a family road trip film. That being said\, the tone of this film is very dreary and I was left in tears by the final few moments of this incredible portrayal of this character. Being hunted down by a group who wishes to wipe out the remaining mutants\, Logan is a much deeper and more serious film than any other film in this franchise. It's not that this film is without any fun\, but you truly feel the impact during each action sequence\, making it much more personal. \n\nWhen director James Mangold helmed The Wolverine\, there were many mixed reviews and reactions to his work. Not that he did a bad job in any way\, but the film itself became a mess towards the end. Knowing exactly what to do for this character's final appearance\, the direction throughout this film is impeccably done. I found myself with my jaw on the floor due to the scenery\, performances\, and overall impact that this film was able to deliver for me. It really doesn't mesh with many of the superhero films we get today\, but that was the most refreshing aspect of my entire viewing experience here. Everything about this film feels. Made like an independent feature film\, there really isn't all that much CGI\, and when there is\, it serves the story and remains minimal. \n\nFrom the very beginning\, Hugh Jackman has owned the character of Logan. Wishing to please fans in every way\, he has always given his all with his portrayal of this titular character\, but truthfully never like this. This is truly the final time we will see a film revolving around this character with Hugh Jackman headlining\, so it was imperative that he gave fans what they deserved after all these years. Jackman puts his heart and soul into this performance and this may just be the best he has ever been. Filled with heartache\, pain\, and loss\, this film is one big love letter to Logan and the X-Men films in general\, even though it's only loosely connected. \n\nIn the end\, Logan balances the fact that is needs to showcase its central character in a compelling way and the fact that is also needs to follow the R-rating of the original comics. It does these things in such a way that feels bittersweet\, making Logan the most personal\, yet brutal tale in the X-Men franchise. While a little too violent for kids (unlike the rest of the franchise)\, a little too vulgar for those who don't like a lot of profanity\, and a conclusion that is a lot to take in if you have been a fan for a long time like myself\, Logan is a masterful experience. From the screenplay\, to the direction\, to a story about the absolute horror that is living with powers that harm you at an old age\, there isn't much to dislike here. I will admit that there are a few too many meta jabs at the X-men comics and the villain is just there to be a villain\, but aside from those two gripes\, Logan is near perfect. I absolutely love this film!",True,0.5590216517448425,0.526046633720398,0.4575633406639099,0.538249671459198,0.42551714181900024,0.5112289190292358,0.49527865648269653,0.49918290972709656,0.5393478274345398

197322,Logan,2017-03-21,5,"Without a doubt\, this is the most powerful Comic book movie you'll likely ever see. Having followed every superhero movie to date\, I've managed to experience a wide range of emotions from watching this type of film. There are those filled with excitement like Captain America Civil War\, and others who prefer to give a more nerd centric focus like X-men Apocalypse. Regardless of which line you prefer\, be it Avengers from Marvel or any of the previous X-men movies\, this movie is going to affect you in a way that you've not experienced before. \n\nThe plot swings between agonizing pity for those who suffer in this chapter\, to savage hatred for those villains causing all the problems with the world they live in. Regardless of those issue's\, the one thing I'm sure you'll experience is a tremendous sense of deep sadness. I can't imagine another movie that pulls on your heartstrings in the way this one does. There are so many moments of loss that you're more than likely going to shed a tear\, all while trying your best to hide the emotions from the rest of the audience. Honestly\, by the time the credits rolled\, I was an emotional wreck. I even found myself feeling sorry for Caliban\, the character we met in Apocalypse who was working as an underground railroad for Mutants. From that movie\, you'd have never expected to see Caliban on the X-men's side of the isle. \n\nPossible Spoiler! The only topic that left me wanting more answers surrounded the reason that the Mutants were dying off. Were told that the Scientist running the team of Mutant commando's/science experiments was the force behind the extinction\, but it's never thoroughly explained. Was this a virus? Were mutants being systematically hunted down one by one? It's possible\, as the team seems to have been successful enough to track Wolverine and Professor X. \n\nSpeaking of Wolverine\, what the hell is happening with him in this movie? Logan seems to believe that his health is deteriorating due to the Adamantium throughout his body and no one seems to know more than Caliban\, yet even he doesn't really go far enough into this topic for my interests. \n\nAnd for the little girl\, OMG! I don't know how anyone managed to get this type of character to work\, as it just screams ridiculous. How would any little girl swing between introvert mute to extrovert mother figure? Somehow though\, she pulls it off and with little issue to boot. There was a point in the movie where the little girl begins to talk after having sliced and diced through a few dozen bad guys which will leave you in total shock. Further complicating things\, the girl seems to have a very bright personality with a large amount of sympathy for both Professor X and Logan\, which in any other situation would be fine\, but remember\, we only recently witnessed her dispatching bad guys as if they were nothing more than a fly on the wall. Also\, were told that the reason that the children in the movie were fleeing to a safe space they refer to as Eden was due to a lack of \""Rage\"". Apparently they were simply not interested in living a life of murder for whatever purpose\, yet they all seemed extremely comfortable in doing so once they were pushed a bit too far. There was one scene where the little girl threatens a store clerk\, all for his sin of requesting she or her parents pay for candies and sunglasses she's put on without purchasing them first. How would this girl be so angry and vicious to the point where Logan would need to prevent her from murdering that clerk\, yet later in the movie when speaking\, she's capable of extremely mature thoughts and emotions? It seemed like a strange plot gap that no one seemed to notice\, because having previously removed a bad guys head\, then carrying it out to confront her assailants\, only to display her actions by tossing the severed head at their feet seems a bit too wide of an emotional and psychological arc to exist within the same character without some serious internal issues\, bordering on bipolar to the extreme. \n\nHopefully up to this point you understand that while there are little grips such as the ones I've pointed out\, nothing stands in the way of this movie being a perfect 10\, but there is one last topic that really does bother me. This is another plot twist that I did not see coming. Again\, Spoilers! What the hell happened in the entire process of trying to create a wolverine of their own would have allowed the bad guys to create a fully aged\, fully identical wolverine? While we are shown some sort of experiment that proved to be more fruitful than the X 23 clone\, aka his daughter\, but nothing was shown beyond a foot in a vat of fluid\, possibly some other item like a hand or something. This creates a really strange feeling in me that I can't seem to shake off. While you can have genetic material from a sample that you could use for cloning\, why would that clone turn out to be an identical clone\, right down to the facial hairstyle? I know that it was probably done to give the audience a feeling of shock and confusion\, and in that regard\, it definitely worked. Even identical twins are slightly off\, not always a perfect match for the other. This clone though\, you wouldn't be able to recognize him from the real Logan in a lineup. \n\nWere told that the reason the Logan clone was superior to the other cloned children was due to their lack of a soul\, so to speak. They would be indifferent to murder\, apparently lacking empathy or the understanding of their own actions\, but at the same time the clone was supposed to follow orders from his mad scientist father as if he were an obedient puppy. I don't understand the logic there. If the obedience comes from a mind that is nothing more than a child that's lacking in experience with the outside world\, a normal upbringing so to speak\, so where would that child then summon the rage the doctor had preferred in his superior product\, the wolverine twin?  \n\nBy the way\, the scene with the Eric Lasalle cameo\, ER's finest\, was as heartbreaking as it was confusing. From the moment Logan and Professor X assisted them with their equine problem\, the family seemed a little too open to a trio of strangers. Of course\, I saw that plot coming a mile away\, as they had already done the same scene in the earlier Wolverine movie with the old couple who take Logan in and allow him to stay in their barn. Those people were murdered by the evil protagonist in that movie\, so I knew that Eric's family was doomed the moment they chose to stay over for the night. Again\, how would anyone invite a trio of strangers over for dinner\, and then also offer them a stay for the night? It was obvious\, but what wasn't obvious was what happened at the end of that story arc\, when Eric Lasalle had already lost his entire family due to their kindness to Professor X and the Wolverines. Once the father recognized that his life was pretty much over after having lost his entire family\, what compelled him to point the shotgun toward logan and pull the trigger? Logan tried several times to walk away\, doing his best to get the Professor to leave that same night\, but failed due to the Professors lack of rest and need for the creature comforts he had been denied in his later years. So\, why would Eric's character want to kill Logan? It just really saddened me to see just how many people turn against you in a desperate moment\, and that feeling hasn't left me all day.  \n\nSo remember\, this movie in my eyes\, is a complete masterpiece\, but with some flaws that don't detract from the power of it's story. I wanted more story\, more explanation\, and far less suffering from our hero's\, but in the end\, had they changed anything\, the story wouldn't have the same affect that it does in this form. Whatever you do\, do yourself a favor and go watch this movie. You don't want to miss experiencing it for yourself. You do not want to miss out on the story\, especially if you're the type that's watched previous X-men movies and felt that they were a little too clean\, too watered down for your tastes. This movie is not the same as those previous editions where Storm bashes Toad with her infamous Lightning taunt/speech. More than likely\, your going to leave this theater having shed a few tears\, and with your stomach in knots. I did! Go see this movie\, make sure you support it\, because if you want to have a little more mature content in your superhero movies\, the only way to show you care is by purchasing a ticket. Your dollars are your vote that says that you want \""this\"" type of superhero movie\, and not the Saturday morning cartoon brought to life version we've seen thus far. \n\nP.S. This movie is violent as #$@!\, so if you have problems with language\, and extreme violence\, don't take your kids with you!

197408,Logan,2017-03-01,5,"With the rise of various cinematic universes designed to go on forever and ever much like the comics that inspire them\, we've lost some things we took for granted in the genre: finality.\n\nBy allowing creatively strong voices to do their own spins on these characters and universes\, we allow for fresh interpretations and above all else\, the opportunity of conclusion you simply won't get from the perpetual movie factories of the MCU or the DECU. Nolan's Batman and now this Wolverine trilogy are the exceptions\, with Logan being the last of a dying breed we may not get a chance to witness anymore. A weirdly fitting metaphor for the movie itself as I'm writting this.\n\nMuch like TDKRises\, Logan presents an emotionally powerful conclusion to a character many\, many movies in the making and portrayed for 15 years by Hugh Jackman. With every one of these films\, from the bad ones to the good\, Jackman has only improved but he runs the gambit this time around from ferocious and monstrous to emotionally vulnerable and sweet. The movie capitalizes on Jackman's range and probably gives one of the most varied performances you're going to find for a comic book movie protagonist. \n\nThis quality of performances permeates throughout the entire cast\, from Patrick Stewart who portrays a very old\, very emotionally fragile Xavier at the tail end of a very long\, very stressful life. Dafnee Keen\, a relatively inexperienced actress manages to avoid the pitfalls of young actors\, selling you on a little girl with a nice tender side who's also capable of ripping you to shreds like a meat grinder if you piss her off.\n\nPre-release\, the swearing and violence got on my nerves. It felt really\, really forced\, a way to placate the moronic Wolverine fantards who's definition of a good Wolverine stories hinges on how bloody a body count he racks up and how many f-bombs he drops while doing so. Initially\, the film didn't really alleviate this fear but as it went along\, both the violence and language add to the experience. This is most definitely not a PG-13 movie masquerading as an R like Deadpool was. \n\nIf there's any real complaint it has to fall to the villains. Both of them offer good performances and unlike the MCU\, they're not portrayed by such quality actors you're going to want to smack Fiege in the face for wasting them.

199255,Logan,2017-03-13,3,"Wow\, Logan lovers seriously need to chill and cut out all this overreacting.  You all bought into the hype of this being Hugh Jackman's last movie as the titular character\, and you were sold.  Sad.  This mindlessly dull\, visually unimaginative borefest is everything that's wrong with Hollywood.  Mind you\, after the smoke is cleared and the hype dies down\, like Star Wars 7\, you will all begin to see that this is not a good film.  It's not that this is terribly bad filmmaking\, it's just altogether uninteresting.  Sure\, it looks more gritty and realistic than other installments (except for the one flying Jackman shot\, a tribute to a really corny idea started by Singer)\, but what does that amount to?  This feels more like film sport than film art.  If you're an aspiring filmmaker and you think this is what good filmmaking is\, I hope you know that quitting is an option you should consider\, and another career is a viable solution.\n\nFirst of all\, don't kid yourself\, this is surely the same old shit\, coated in an R-rating so you feel like a bad kid doing a dangerous thing behind your parents back.  It amounts to taking a fantasy story about a little girl who can destroy anybody\, who in real life would anihilate her\, and forcing you to take it extremely seriously.  Serious R-rated movie about mutants\, ROFL!  Mangold does everything he can to fight back against the wonderment and joy of the Bryan Singer films\, which give us fun\, color\, and adventure.  Instead\, Mangold retreads the same ground as he did with The Wolverine - slow\, tedious melodrama\, long drawn out glorified violence within action sequences that have no stakes because once again the heroes can just destroy anything and the bad guys are a bunch of idiots for repeatedly contending.\n\nAnd what are X-Men fans who have stuck by loyally for almost two decades treated to in the Wolverine's final outing?  Sabretooth?  Deadpool?  Someone new and interesting?  No\, the climax is him vs him\, and not in any kind of literary or psychologically symbolic form\, but Logan vs his underdeveloped clone.  All physical brawn\, no brains\, except for the adamantium bullet the clone takes.  What a lame device.  Nobody surrounding them is interesting\, I don't even know who the villain is supposed to be... Luke Skywalker?  What's with the hand thing\, is that all he's got?  I came to this film to see Patrick Stewart\, he gave a solid performance\, and the rest is disappointing.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the Lord of the Flies gang - seriously people?  You really should be ashamed of yourselves if this is what tickles your fancy.  Little kids fighting adults should look more like Hook - this is appalling.  This and the clone fight insufficiently make up the third act.  Despite all the wonderful things Deadpool did\, I still felt it came up short because of a lame\, one-dimensional\, colorless villain.  I said that as long as they never make that mistake again\, these movies could be amazing.  I never thought they would reach lower into their pocket and pull out something as egregiously low as this hand guy.  He might've been interesting had he tried having a human moment like masturbating and accidentally pulling his dick off because he couldn't control that lame contraption on his wrist.  Anything at all would've been more interesting than the action film conventionalism we were spoon fed.\n\nUltimately\, the idea of all this superpower crap is just silly\, nobody should ever really buy it as it's sold.  So why do I like some of them\, and not others?  I like the ones that have fun with it.  Batman is the only good excuse for taking itself more seriously\, and even that has to come in minimal doses; it still has to have fun to work\, and Dark Knight gives us that fun in at least the form of Joker.  If you're going to introduce these ideas\, be bold and adventurous\, go all the way with it.  Days of Future Past introduces time travel and ripple effects\, those are great sci-fi concepts.  Apocalypse has a doomsday device with an equivalent counter in Phoenix.  If it's going to take itself more seriously\, the type of story has to allow for it\, like in Unbreakable\, which slowly unveils a truth that the audience isn't aware of... that simply can't happen in an established superhero franchise like X-Men\, you can't fool an audience that way.  And then there's the everything package that Kick-Ass gives us\, introducing a very real world in a very comic book world with just the right balance of humor and drama that can only be expressed cinematically.  I don't get how people can take Wolverine seriously in this context\, but it proves we're living in an ever-increasing age where people are forcing themselves to be more serious about everything in life\, and it sucks.",True,0.3811309337615967,0.33832845091819763,0.32307931780815125,0.3557521104812622,0.319429874420166,0.3443129360675812,0.3449019491672516,0.34946340322494507,0.36769792437553406

Hugh Jackman is\, of course\, very good as Logan and this will be his last movie playing Wolverine - you'll see why when you watch the movie. And Dafne Keen puts in a great performance as Laura (X-23). It is quite disturbing\, though\, to see a young kid perpetrating such intense violence.

Let that sink in as you read this review. 16 years of Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine/Logan and finally we find out what made this character so gripping in the comics. Now it's film adaptation gives a realistic view of the brutality and desolate life of Logan. Its strength comes from its connection to the main character and how everything leads to a single perspective. The action is grim and hyperbolic\, but gives audiences the devastation of the pain that lies in Logans old physique. Logan takes you places other X-Men movies in the franchise have never gone and makes a mark to where this series of comic book films should go. It takes the heart and passion of the characters and gives them a form of humanity for audiences to empathize with.

96844,Logan,2017-01-31,5,"17 years ago\, we were all introduced to relatively unknown Australian actor Hugh Jackman as the amnesiac and claw-wielding mutant Wolverine in the blockbuster X-Men. He made a huge impression on viewers by flawlessly capturing the brood cynicism of the character in his first outing and expanded on his development through a series of sequels and standalone films that detailed his personal loses\, growing world weariness and savagery\, and solidified him as the definitive film version Wolverine. Today we witness the end of his journey in Logan\, a swan song for both series stars Jackman and Patrick Stewart as Logan and Professor Charles Xavier respectively. Inspired by the comic book Old Man Logan\, We see the ex-X-Man in a even more broken state as his age catches up with him due to his regenerative powers functioning slowly than usual. He makes a living as a limo driver while hiding out in the Border with aging\, dementia-inflicted Xavier after all world's mutants have died out\, including the X-Men. Logan's plans to put his legacy behind are put to a halt with he crosses paths with a child who possesses the same abilities as his and is sought out by a sinister organization. Logan is left with no other choice but to protect her and fight off these deadly forces in one last battle that's high in stakes\, emotions and body count. Director James Mangold\, who helmed 2013's The Wolverine\, delivers a blood-soaked and somber sci-fi-drama-cum-thriller that is far removed from the X-Men films in terms of spectacle\, bright visuals and the PG-13 rating and goes for it's own gritty\, Western-like style complete with an R -rating\, and it's a very hard R. Wolverine is no longer restricted by the safe and marketable PG-13 where we only see those claws merely phase through baddies and is finally allowed to literally cut loose as we witness him disembowel and decapitate people and draw copious amounts of blood in a never-endingly grisly manner\, and it's the way he was meant to be portrayed. Logan grounded style remains consistent throughout and never succumbs to a standard\, overly extravaganza superhero; it's just sequences of brutality and unforgiving antagonists. Jackman gives it his all as a character who is more miserable than ever and seeks an end to his pain. Stewart acts as a perfect foil as the equally broken Xavier\, once an optimist who continued to fight for his cause of human-mutant equality\, is now older\, delirious and his power on the fritz as well. Seeing the two men broken\, no longer surrounded by the family they built and stuck in their distraught and decrepit positions after following them all these years is heartbreaking\, but their continued support for one another despite their salty bickering serves as the emotional backbone of the film along with it's sense of humor as both Logan and Xavier are more fowl mouthed than usual. It's the kind of dysfunctional father-son dynamic that lifts the film's spirits.  ???'????work and dedication he put in bringing this fan favorite character to life and big ups to Fox for giving in and delivering the Wolverine movie we've all waited to see. The film has a lot of highlights and one of then is newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura\, a.k.a. X-23\, an adorable but deadly little girl who shares Logan's regenerative abilities and retractable Adamantium claws and this young actress is able to hold her own with the veteran actors. As with Stewart and Jackman\, she and Jackman also add a parent-child dynamic that adds levity and tenderness to a film this harsh all while Keen get to display a range of emotions perfectly with minimal lines. Oh\, and she kicks so much fucking ass and keeps ticking. I have a feeling that this girl will go places. Logan is a bleak\, poignant and gloriously violent send off for the title character with a moving direction\, strong script that's full of surprises and solid performances. In conclusion\, I want to say \""Thank you\"" to Hugh Jackman for the years of hard work and dedication he put in bringing this fan favorite character to life and big ups to Fox for giving in and delivering the Wolverine movie we've all waited to see.",True,0.8682828545570374,0.8160890340805054,0.8380692601203918,0.8551908135414124,0.8200545310974121,0.844373345375061,0.8421450853347778,0.8702458143234253,0.829592227935791

96846,Logan,2017-03-11,4,"17 years sure feels like it was just yesterday...I can still remember reading the issue of Premiere magazine (now definct) giving a sneak peek at the very first X-Men movie. I'd dreamed of this since I was a child collecting Marvel cards. How on earth could Hollywood pull of an X-Men feature film? At least I could finally see all the actors/actresses in full costume and get an idea of what the film would actually be like. It was then that I viewed the unknown Hugh Jackman for the first time\, sporting those familiar claws. I personally thought Kurt Russell was a better fit at the time\, but Mr. Jackman at least looked the part\, so I was willing to give him a chance. To say that the guy nailed the role is like saying Connery wasn't too bad playing that Bond dude. He owned it from his very first scene.\n\nWell\, all good things must come to an end\, and 2017's Logan sure makes you feel it. It starts off bleak and only gets worse. It's 2029 and Wolverine is dying. His adamantium skeleton has gradually begun to poison his body\, severely affecting his healing capabilities. He now cares for a much older (and unusually vulgar) Professor Xavier\, who himself is now suffering from a degenerative brain disorder. All the other X-Men are \""gone\"" and mutants have seemingly ceased to exist. Fun stuff. In fact\, it's almost TOO bleak...that is until the young Laura (the show-stopping Dafne Keen) enters the picture and sets the flick on fire. No spoilers\, but every action scene she's involved in is absolutely jaw-dropping. Laura is being hunted by the robo-handed Pierce and his goons in an effort to return her to the lab where she was born. This little one refuses to come quietly though. One fatal showdown later\, and it's highway time for Logan\, Xavier and the mysterious Laura. The story very much has the feel of a classic western. The villains even have a \""tracker\"" in tragic mutant Caliban and the movie \""Shane\"" is referenced more than once. Blood-drenched claw fights\, awesome action and a surprising amount of depth give way to easily the best Wolverine solo outing. It's also\, sadly\, Jackman's last. Yes\, he's finally hung up the claws\, but he's done so with style and grace. What he's accomplished with this character is not likely to be equaled anytime soon.

97100,Logan,2017-03-02,5,4 1/2 Stars. I'm down if they just want to make R rated super hero movies from here on out. I won't lie it gets a little much after awhile but still was nice to see how Wolverine's story plays out uncensored. Its not as emotionally satisfying of a film as I hoped but still worked wonders and there's definitely some soul in the film. It's surprisingly dark film though. Usually these films have just dark tones but this film really is dark at it's core; It's also what makes it so human at the same time. Very overlong which makes the violence seem a bit much because of how waring the film is most of the time. You will leave the theatre either moved or incredibly depressed.

When everything we wish to see happen never happen when all what we fought for never saw eye to eye with what the times wish to see. When we see we cannot fight what we see and what we can't see to only suppress our abilities before we cause any more attention and trouble we wish not see. When we see its easy to escape our problems to only be left alone without having to feel we are not accepted. When we see its harder to escape our problems when we have to live with it our whole lives when it's who we are and what we done that makes who we are at the end of our life. When we see we can't escape who we are now when we are all alone and see all is gone and nothing more we could do there is no fighting required of us to fight. When we see we accept the time and place we now see to only let life see fit how life should live. When we see who we are as human and non-human we see only one is accepted to live freely. When what others see in us we never could see as a weapon made to be contained and control by the vary thing that sees fit only dominating and reigning.

When we try to see but can't see when our abilities are weakening to only have others pay us a visit to see that there is hope. When we see a world where human and non-human can co-exist when they are used as weapons and slaved  from birth. When we see others escape such captivity when they see that somethings are not right when they are human & non-human with God and scientific abilities that don't deserve to be see and used for what the world doesn't intend and life doesn't intend. When we see who are like us when others need hope and hope is not in sight to meet face to face what we couldn't see a future. When we don't know what to make in what we see to only see away out. When we see we lived far too long to be seen as a burden\, a cash grab\, a resource to only see the worst that all we are regarded as is a breakthrough worth seeing closer in what can benefit human life and not mutant life. When we see we missed out on so much\, to arrive in what we never could see too late when what we keep deep side is the humanness to live in what we never could accept in ourselves being\, whether it was a family man\, simple life\, a home to stay and raise a life in we chose a life on the run\, full of revenge\, hate\, and death.

Spurred on by the solid reviews the film has garnered leading up to its release. \""Finally the Wolverine the fans have been waiting for\"" is a line that has been used quite often in the write-ups. Well\, if the fans were waiting for a tired alcoholic who doesnt give a shit about himself or anyone else then sure\, you get what you have been waiting for. I on the other hand maintain that this is not the Wolverine from the comics. He never felt sorry for himself like this. If he did \, he sure didn't show it.\n\n\n\nBesides that his alcoholism has been dialed up to eleven\, there really isn't much difference between  where we find Logan at the start of The Wolverine (2014) and where we find him when he is introduced at the outset of Logan. He has remembered to shave\, and cut his hair still\, because we find Logan working as a limo driver. You know\, what fans always wanted to see. I maintain that Hugh\, the writers\, producers and the braintrust have never gotten this character right. The notion that Wolverine is working as a chauffeur is so baffling to me I struggle making heads or tails of it.\n\nThe comic book character was always a surly bastard\, but he always had a certain charm. A killer through and through \, who deep down hates himself not only for being \""the best at what he does\"" \, but also for liking it.\n\nOne of the cool aspects of the Old Man Logan book was how Logan had essentially retired \, and sworn of violence. In that story he is still very much capable of doing \""what he does best\"" \, but due a horrible incident years past he chooses not to. But this is NOT an adaptation of Old Man Logan. Not even close. The only thing that this film shares with that story is the presence of Logan. Other than that there is no similarity. OML takes place in a post apocalyptic world where the Marvel heroes are all but wiped out\, and the world is ruled by an assortment of villains. In James Mangold's Logan \, society has not really changed. Technology has actually improved quite a bit\, and for those reviewers who are calling this post-apocalyptic\, I say they need to find a dictionary and look up the meaning of the phrase.\n\nEvery aspect of the modern world is pretty much hunkydory here. Infrastructure is fine. All modern conveniences are still there. TV and radio is still going strong. Kids are going to prom \, and basically there isn't any difference between this world and the world we have seen in previous installments. There is however an absence of mutants\, which is never explained. Something about them not being born anymore. There is a short mention on a newscast where the line \"" It's 2029\, why are we still talking about mutants\"" is uttered. This would lead one to think that mutants have been long gone\, but then later we learn that mutants and indeed the X-men were around as recently as 2028. What became of them is never explained either. Its alluded to \, and viewers can sort of put it together but for me it just makes certain character motivations even more bizarre.\n\nlogan-trailer-breakdown-3-700x295\n\nSo the plot to this film is dirt simple. Logan is working as a limo driver\, trying to raise cash so he buy a boat for himself and a senile foul mouthed Charles Xavier. They are held up at a scrapyard in Mexico for some reason. Logan then is introduced to a young mutant who shares similar \""abilities\"" to his own . This girl is being hunted by a gang of mercenaries under the employ of some company that wants her for some reason. Logan then reluctantly has to help this girl cross the border into Canada because as long as they get to Canada they will be safe. That's pretty much it \, and the film spends it two and half hour runtime showing this chase.\n\nThe merchs are lead by a man named Pierce \, played by Boyd Holbrook . Him and his infinite amount of henchmen are \""enhanced\"" individuals. And by enhanced I mean most of them has had one of their hand replaced by a robotic hand. That's it.  They answer to a certain Dr Rice \, played by Richard E Grant\, who´s sole purpose is to deliver useless exposition from time to time.\n\nThe reason I find this film unimaginative is due to the fact that its basically rehashing plot points from the previous two Wolverine films. It constantly stops the forward momentum of the story in order to show our \""heroes\"" either talking in cars\, or talking in rooms. In between these boring scenes there are some brutal sequences where Wolverine goes into berserker mode\, but its nothing we haven't already seen in the previous films\, but with added blood guts and decapitations.\n\nThe film is competently shot by James Mangold. I thought the score \, and some of the music cues were weird as hell. Hugh Jackman does the same performance that he always has in these films. The villains are nondescript and ultimately not worth talking about. Patrick Stewart makes a radical shift in his performance as Professor Xavier. I found that pretty funny at times. The young mutant girl Laura played by Dafne Keen does well enough. The fight scenes involving her were quite good\, but as far as acting goes I got flashbacks to the kid from the Omen remake. I wish this movie had turned out better. I think it would be helped if it was cut down to 90-100 minutes.It does not fill out its 2h 17min runtime very well. \n\nFun fact. 10 seconds after this shot the theatre was filled with laughter .\nFun fact. 10 seconds after this shot the theatre was filled with laughter .\nThere are references to events which i was much more interested in knowing about\, but these are never explained.Not much is.  It ends in a pretty anti-climactic manner \, and as i mentioned at the beginning\, my first word when the screen fades to black was simply : F@ck.\n\n \n\n-Razz",True,0.5632506012916565,0.5612419247627258,0.5562743544578552,0.5746997594833374,0.5499488711357117,0.5583429336547852,0.5747522711753845,0.5574535727500916,0.5467873811721802

98548,Logan,2017-10-21,5,"Absolutely\, without a doubt\, the single best superhero movie I have ever seen. Not only that\, it is on the very top of my list of favorite \""real movies\"" as well. I can't really come up with a better movie at this moment.\n\nWe went to see Logan in the RPX so we could choose our seat. However\, it was a Tuesday and the RPX is double the price of the discounted Tuesday prices for other showings that there wasn't a packed theater. This meant no distractions and we could focus on the movie.\n\nI can't go into too much detail here\, I don't want this to have spoilers\, but I can say I will post again and break it down. The movie had a huge personal impact.\n\nWhat I can say is this is not your Avenger's big tent action movie. The focus is on an aging Logan\, Professor X and a young Laura (c'mon its not a spoiler if its in the trailer). Laura is being hunted by a group of powerful mercenaries and Logan and Professor X are trying to protect her.\n\nThe R rating does allow people to see the brutality of what it would be like to fight Wolverine\, limbs and heads amputated\, faces clawed open and the absolute monster that Wolverine could be in a fight. That however was not what the rating really made better. The storytelling was much better. It could handle much more adult subjects such as aging\, consequences of a life of conflict\, and family. This movie is not for someone who is a child or who is only interested in a mutant battle. If that is the limit of a movie you are interested\, go see the new Thor\, Spider Man or Guardians of the Galaxy movies coming out this summer.\n\nI won't say anything else about the plot of the movie except to say it mirrors Deadpool in a way. Instead of redefining a superhero movie into a darker comedy\, Logan transforms this movie into a gritty western as much as a superhero movie. It has a very broad\, if very adult\, scope for an audience. Some have talked about Oscars. I think it would be justified to receive best actor/supporting actor nominations if not the actual Oscars themselves.\n\nThe emotional impact of this movie hit both me and the hubby that night. It was near the anniversary of my father's death (one year) and there were a lot of similarities\, the movie was like a gut punch. Those I will talk about in my next post about Logan where I can break out spoilers.\n\nThe biggest takeaway I saw another critic say is that the R rating is an excellent injection into the superhero niche. Not for violence\, but for the way it can open a story up and allow superhero movies to grow up and become full stories\, not just comics.\n\nIt has been reported that this is Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's last movie each for their characters. 20 years of Wolverine and Professor X wrapped up on the best superhero movie made. I am sad they are turning in their characters\, but I have to say it was absolutely the best movie they could have chosen to do so.\n\nThe good: Absolutely the best acting in any superhero movie\, and in the top for conventional movies. The story is tight\, not distracted with explosions or too many special effects. It satisfies both the action need and the story need that no other superhero movie can.\n\nThe bad: It is the last movie with Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman playing their characters.",True,0.686854362487793,0.6665830612182617,0.6507139801979065,0.6912963390350342,0.6607596278190613,0.6742647886276245,0.6660594940185547,0.6943787336349487,0.64627605676651

99659,Logan,2017-04-25,4,"A fitting farewell.  So Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) isn't the superhero he used to be.  It is far more painful and exhausting for him to heal\, so he no longer actively picks fights.  All he wants to do is drive a limo and stow away a little bit of extra cash for him and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) to retire.  It seems like life has other plans\, and he crosses paths with a young mutant (Dafne Keen) that needs to be escorted to the U.S./Canada border in North Dakota.  Now I have liked the majority of these X-Men movies (although I thought Apocalypse was extremely lackluster)\, but I have seldom loved them.  They are usually competent\, but there has always been something that has held me back\, maybe it is just my lack of familiarity with the source material.  I think that Logan is their best movie to date.  Now this movie only exists due to one thing alone: the huge financial smash success that is Deadpool\, although tonally\, these two movies couldn't be further apart (obviously).  Sure\, we have had R-rated comic book movies before\, like Spawn\, Blade and Kick-Ass\, but their box office returns were peanut shells when compared to the Merc with a Mouth.  Wolverine has always been a character that makes more sense to be rated R: he uses profanity all the time with a curmudgeonly attitude\, and he has blades that come out of his hands.  That has always been a problem for me with these movies: this character is slicing and dicing people up\, and there is always little to no bloodshed\, which\, in a word\, is nonsensical.  With Logan\, it gets graphically violent with dismemberment in a way that has never been done before in this entire series.  In addition to that fixed problem\, another issue on why I usually have a disconnect with this series is because there is just so many mutants\, it is difficult to keep up with.  They pulled way back on this\, and so much more of this is focused on Wolverine\, Professor X and this young girl\, and it does nothing but enhance the pathos of the story.  Now Jackman has been playing Wolverine for almost two decades\, and I know he's got to be getting tired of playing this muscular character and eating whole chickens in the middle of the night for the protein needed to stay in such peak physical condition.  I do believe this is finally it for Jackman and Stewart\, even with the ability of time travel already brought into the mix previously.  The story itself has teeth\, and there are lots of Western tropes featured here which is something that I can personally appreciate\, and there are even shots where Jackman looks like a ringer for Clint Eastwood.  There is a real emotional charge to it\, and the story does nothing but benefit from it.  I really dug this movie more than I thought I would.",True,0.0809720829129219,0.09770259261131287,0.08571117371320724,0.09510177373886108,0.08810032904148102,0.07863464206457138,0.0705285593867302,0.11125115305185318,0.06456038355827332

99731,Logan,2017-03-10,5,"After 17 years of bringing the X-Men character Wolverine to life\, Hugh Jackman is hanging his claws up and going off into the sunset. While his tenure as Wolverine has had its up and downs\, Jackman is definitely going out on a high note. Logan is a masterclass in terms of story and character with enough action and fan service to please both long time fans as well as new comers. While it is not quite a perfect film\, this is still one of the best comic book films ever made and more importantly sends a character out in a blaze of glory. \n\nThe film revolves around Logan in the year 2029 where he and Charles Xavier are hiding out after the mutants have basically dissipated where only a few are left in the world. However\, after a woman and a small mutant girl\, named Laura\, find Logan\, he must journey north to possibly find more mutants and save the girl from the company trying to capture her. This is a relatively vague description but I feel that Logan is a movie that should be seen with as few details as possible to truly get the most out of it. The progression of the story is very thorough and by the end of the film you feel like you have been taken on a journey. Sure\, it is a road trip film at it's core\, but there are so many heart filled and truly human moments that you feel the weight in every scene. Plus\, the end of the film is one of the most poetic moments in recent years and I applaud the writers here for giving a movie that is superb to the end.\n\nAnother thing that helps this story is the fact that it truly grasped the film's R rating and actually deserves it. Logan/Wolverine has always felt a bit nerfed in terms of his violent ways but here his brutality is on display. Logan basically feels worthless and has nothing to lose\, so his violent ways back this up and show how much he is willing to fight for what little bit he does have. The violence in this is brutal and unapologetic making for some truly great moments. The language does seem a bit excessive at times but it feeds into where these characters are compared to 17 years ago\, so in the end it all feels right. Basically Logan is a rare film where the rating is a method for story progression rather than exploitation for ticket sales.\n\nThe acting in this film is top notch with Hugh Jackman giving his best performance to date. He has always embodied this character but this time he left it all on floor and gives us something truly special. Patrick Stewart plays Xavier for his final time as well and gives us what we love about him with an added dose of humor. We get a new villain named Pierce played by Boyd Holbrook and he is a really well rounded villain fit for the film. However\, the person who nearly steals the show is Dafne Keen as Laura. Keen is a great fit in the role and delivers some heartfelt moments as well as some of the best action scenes in the film.\n\nJames Mangold directed this film and he really made something special here. He crafted this futuristic film in the way of a western and somehow made this film work. His eye for action is second to none with brutal moments followed by scenes that will bring you on the verge of crying. Mangold also directed 2013?s The Wolverine but here he learned from the mistakes of that film and made this feel more human and grounded to deliver a film revolving around mutants feel as if we are watching an award winning drama. Basically\, Mangold did what every director should do when handed scripts like these.\n\nWhile I truly love this film the more I think about it\, I have to admit there is one issue here: the pacing. The film clocks in at 2 hours and 17 minutes and while most scenes do fit extremely well\, some do drag and you feel it. This does not make the film bad by any stretch of the word\, but it is an issue that you probably will see when you see it. When the film is firing on all cylinders you will love it but in those slower scenes\, you kinda wonder why the didn't trim the fat by just a few minutes.\n\nAll in all\, Logan is one of the best comic book films to date and a film that you must see. Even if you haven't followed the X-Men franchise\, this is a film that tells an amazing story of family and finding yourself that everyone can relate to. It does have a pacing issue in some scenes\, but other than that this is a film that you will talk about for years to come. Just keep in mind that this film is rated R for a reason and just because it has a superhero is in it\, that doesn't mean your children should see it.",True,0.009385415352880955,0.0069825854152441025,0.007159459870308638,0.007462282199412584,0.009987443685531616,0.010345133021473885,0.007353092078119516,0.009799845516681671,0.007289539556950331

99733,Logan,2017-03-14,4,"After 2 critical and box office misfires\, it would seem that the standalone Wolverine film was cursed to fail... until now. Ditching the tired superhero movie formula\, this is linear\, leaner and grittier than before\, amping up the character study and pathos for a more sombre and mature exercise in storytelling. We are down to 3 X-Men characters on top of the mysterious Laura - a young girl who provides the main thrust of the narrative by seeking the help of Logan\, or James Howlett to be exact\, an exhausted wreck of his previous self and now working as a limo driver after unidentified incidents saw him and Charles Xavier living in exile in Mexico. Free from the shackles of the X-Men series (the meta-nod half way through the film is an inspired move) and the family friendly rating\, the film is more low-key and brooding; the action sequences\, when they happen but not as often as you expect\, are more brutal and bloodied and the language more naturally sprinkled with expletives. Clearly influenced and played out like a Western\, this film is all about redemption\, aging and mortality and it is a beautiful and touching film that gives both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart (and even Stephen Merchant who plays the new Bristolian Caliban) the opportunity to show themselves as proper actors capable of gravitas and emotional layers while slashing people's faces off. Last year's Deadpool signals that the oversaturated superhero genre can survive having\, or maybe even needed\, the postmodern piss taken out of it and laughed all the way to big box office returns. And now\, Logan proves that the genre needs to keep evolving in order to sustain the interests of a jaded and unimpressed audience\, not with bigger explosions or endless violence - though well crafted and visceral sequences like the ones we have here are certainly welcomed - but original storytelling that doesnt feel repetitive or overfamiliar while having the guts to take a little risk from time to time.",True,0.021869411692023277,0.019529467448592186,0.01763293333351612,0.02039879746735096,0.01570950448513031,0.022090235725045204,0.021418767049908638,0.020128972828388214,0.02194576896727085

99854,Logan,2017-03-10,5,"After many years and some disappointments\, X-Men fans finally have the R rated Wolverine movie we always wanted. And it's all we could have hoped for. Logan is not only graphic\, gory\, and action packed\, it's also a work of surprising depth and thoughtfulness that does as much as the best comic book story-line to show us the real Wolverine. \n\nThe last two installments covered his past\, to mixed effect. This film instead takes us to his future. And what a future it is. The X-Men are long gone\, no mutants have born in years\, and Logan can barely remember a time he thought of himself as hero. These day's he's just a down on his luck driver; renting out Professor X's limo by the hour to pay for food\, booze\, and the medicine keeping the old man alive. Until a seemingly random encounter with a desperate woman and a very special girl forces him to embark on one last adventure.\n\nMarvel has given us many interesting takes on the superhero genre in recent years. They've done it as Hero's Journey\, pared down revenge tale\, ensemble spectacular\, shoot 'em up spy thriller\, and riotous self-parody. This is the superhero adventure as Man with No Name western. A visually desolate\, slowly intensifying tale of a lone grizzled hero on the edge of society taking a stand to protect the vulnerable\, even knowing what it will cost him. There's no happy ending waiting at the end of the line\, but there may a measure of absolution and chance to truly feel alive once more.\n\nHugh Jackman is masterful in the title role. He's played Wolverine so many times in the last seventeen years that he's practically become the character\, and he channels all of his experience and talent into bringing him to life once more.  This version of Wolverine is far removed from the rage fueled\, semi-feral monster we glimpsed in Origins and Apocalypse. But the anger is still there deep inside. Anger that the dream he fought so hard for is dead\, along with all his friends. Anger at his own failing powers and declining health. And anger at himself for being unable to stop it. He's keenly aware that he's become a shadow of his former self\, and it's eating him up inside.\n\nThe anger shows though in his bitterness\, cynicism and disillusionment\, his near endless stream of curses\, his insistence that he doesn't owe anyone anything or care about their problems. But the anger is overshadowed by an even deeper emptiness. Jackman's every line and action radiates a profound sense of tiredness. It's clear that he's barely going through the motions of life. He doesn't want to fight anymore\, or run\, or maybe even go on living. But he keeps fighting because he doesn't have a choice and because at the end of the day it's all he knows. This version of Logan is so complex\, compelling\, and deeply flawed\, and Jackman and the writers should both get an Oscar for it.\n\nFor his part\, Patrick Stewart is sometimes profound\, sometimes pathetic\, but always tragic as the ailing\, addled Professor Xavier. Once of the world's greatest thinkers- and its most powerful telepath- he's now reduced by dementia to a confused and often barely lucid old man. His introduction will make you want to laugh and cry at the same time.  And the scenes of him bickering about having to take his medicine will be all too real for anyone who's seen Alzheimer's firsthand. Then in his occasional moments of clarity he's once again the wise mentor and psychic we know and love; a paraplegic Yoda. \n\nYet in a way it's almost worse then\, because that's when the weight of reality comes crashing down on him\, reminding him of what he had and who he was. And it's then that the seizures are closest. Seizures that can kill everyone for miles around\, and maybe have. Even with this sci-fi twist\, Stewart's portrayal is almost stunning in its realism. He probably deserves an Oscar too. \n\nSo Logan is obviously grim and somber\, but not to the point of being overwhelming. Believe it or not this movie actually has a sense of humor\, albeit subdued and rather dark. And rather than a maudlin tearjerker or a brooding emo-fest (like a certain other superhero blockbuster) it feels like an elegy to what might have been. Throughout it there's a profound sense that something went very\, very wrong at some point\, and that ever since the people in this film have barely gotten by\, surviving among the remnants of their shattered dreams. On some level this could be an allegory for rust belt America.\n\nBut of course\, this isn't just a brooding meditation or intimate personal drama; it's a hard-boiled action movie too. And Logan takes just the right balance between these elements. The slower sections\, in which the story unfolds and characters develop\, mostly retain enough suspense to keep the film from dragging. And the action scenes are frequent and long enough to deliver thrills and keep things moving\, but not to the point of becoming boring or repetitive. \n\nPlus they're really good. The fights are fast paced\, expertly shot\, and brutally visceral. The gore is a bit less than in DeadPool or Django\, but there's still plenty of severed limbs and skewered heads. I particularly enjoyed the car chase battle\, which was more than a bit reminiscent of Mad Max. And the final battle against Weapon X's latest creation was impressive in its brutality and sense of desperation. But the best fights are the ones with the girl.\n\nThe young Dafne Keen is captivating and downright awesome as a younger\, Mexican version of X-23. When we meet her she's shy and unassuming\, but when things get hot she turns into a whirling dynamo of claws and feral energy. Seeing her lung\, flip\, and hack her way through dozens of opponents\, latching on to larger enemies and stabbing them again and again like a homicidal monkey\, one feels awestruck and perhaps unstintingly amused by her athleticism and ferocity. It's like someone crossed Wolverine with Dora the Explorer\, and it's absolutely brilliant.\n\nThis doesn't mean Logan is perfect. The filmmakers could have cut about 10 to 15 minutes without losing anything\, and I was a bit disappointed that they didn't come up with anything more creative for the final enemy. But these are minor qualms. On whole it's a brilliant and breathtaking twist on the genre\, a graphic meditation on aging\, masculinity\, and the intertwined nature of heroism and violence. It's grim\, gory\, profane\, and sometimes profound\, and it's absolutely the sendoff that Wolverine- and the fans- deserve.",True,0.19469426572322845,0.18890200555324554,0.12473874539136887,0.16240385174751282,0.15516936779022217,0.15730296075344086,0.14687323570251465,0.1831166297197342,0.1436539739370346

When he realizes his crime committed to those he had spent so long nurturing and acting as a father figure to\, especially as a senile old man\, that truly was heartbreaking. Logan still has his hard-earned pessimism but you really get a feel of how exhausted of life he is. \n\nMy one gripe were the villains were kind of bland for me\, though they do serve their purpose  as vehicles for ideologies. I do have a higher expectation from Xmen to have villains be more than just bad guys in costume up to no good\, and while that wasn't exactly the case here I did find their depth more on the lacking side.\n\nIn all\, I felt the movie really did a great job focusing on characters and relationships and showed how the Xmen were not a superteam\, but a surrogate family.",True,0.1511625200510025,0.04089727997779846,0.011256752535700798,0.024885674938559532,0.003266707994043827,0.02991667203605175,0.027020277455449104,0.02269924059510231,0.12785710394382477

But it is also much more earnest and emotional. It's a reflection on aging\, legacies\, and ultimately\, hope.\n\nIt may not be the greatest superhero film of all-time\, but it is quite up there.

There were 3 villains in this flick and all of which fell flat\, with Donald Pierce starting off incredibly as a villain with a cool look and even cooler dialogue\, he then spent almost every other scene being made to look like no threat to anyone.\nThe first main problem\, the smallest one\, was the inclusion of Caliban. This character proved to be pointless\, only being used in order to have certain things happen within the film\, and to be used as a sacrifice which gave no emotion\, only a sigh of relief that the main characters could get out alive. A poor waste of a good character\, and a good actor.

And Wolverine\, all in all\, was killed from a Tree. The emotion of Wolverine's death only coming in the last shot. For 2 characters - the film specific versions - that have been loved\, and constantly building in character\, for 17 years\, these deaths were not given the time\, or emotion\, that they deserved.\nPerhaps a 3/5 is harsh\, but considering the hype that this film got\, and still has\, these flaws really should not be in the film.",True,0.7253097891807556,0.7007140517234802,0.6819537281990051,0.7041665315628052,0.6924349665641785,0.6879802346229553,0.6678765416145325,0.7201806902885437,0.7240474224090576

But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy abruptly end when a mysterious woman appears with an urgent request--that Logan shepherd an extraordinary young girl to safety.\n\nMan.

I feel like because they went with this R rating\, they were able to take Wolverine's character to his full potential and I loved it. \n\nThis movie looked great and along with that\, the screenplay was very well done. All of the characters were very well written and the girl did not for a second feel like dead weight. The story progressed really nicely and there were plenty of thrilling moments accompanied by emotional moments. The story was well told and had a natural progression.

Like things have happened. And on top of all of this grim but wonderful detail\, Logan even goes to the effort to have a good plot. It would have been so easy to have some throwaway mustache-twiddling villain who's out to end all mutants and blah blah blah and Logan has to stop him (yes\, I know it's based on a comic and the story existed beforehand)\, but this movie really outdid itself with a plot that's engaging and extremely compelling.

The same rage that prevents him from growing as an individual or opening himself up to new people is what keeps him alive and in battle.

Its sad\, dark angle befits the premise: the main character is being poisoned by his own super-powered skeleton. This angle\, however\, crosses the line from dark to melodramatic as mentions and visual imagery of blood\, pus\, brains\, and guts overshadow the \""internal struggle\"" Logan is supposed to be enduring. The supposed \""deep existential crisis\"" that Logan suffers regarding his repeated murders of people around him is unbelievable when he repeatedly\, intentionally goes out of his way to kill people when he had the option to do literally anything else. His counterweights\, the optimistic Charles Xavier and adorable daughter Laura balance out Logan's grit and angst...or\, that is\, they would if they had anything meaningful to say throughout the movie. Laura is mute until the very end\, which serves as a clever bait-and-switch at the expense of her narrative potential as a character\, and Charles spends most of his time on screen explaining that Logan is indeed dying without adding why it's happening or what to do about it. Even the villains are carelessly slapped together: their organization manufactures child soldiers from the DNA of mutants like Wolverine and are trying to track down Laura and the other mutants like her because they are the creations of said organizations and do not deserve to see the outside world. Individually\, however\, these characters have no depth. There's a scientist\, a bounty hunter\, and a Wolverine clone\, and that's all you'll ever learn about them.\n\nThe Good: convincing acting\, Charles being adorable when he's not spouting faux exposition\, Laura being charming when she finally opens her mouth\n\nThe Bad: sub-par comic relief\, lack of clear exposition and motivation for villains\, two most engaging characters rambling on about how Logan is \""being POISONED\"" and staying mute for most of the film\, respectively\n\nVerdict: I'd recommend this to die-hard fans of X-Men who would watch anything with Wolverine's face on it and literally nobody else.

There was no world-ending problems\, no krazy battle that needed to take place on a elevated platform\, or stopping some blue light shooting in the sky.

Every one played off each other very well and by the end you felt the connection between all the main characters. \nAnother great addition to this movie is its R rating. It's so satisfying to finally see Wolverine be able to really cut into people and do some real visual damage. And seeing 11 year old girl just murder people all Savage like is just amazing. Takes me back to when I first saw Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass....

121877,Logan,2018-09-24,5,"For the most part\, superhero movies are family friendly romps that eventually end with a final battle being won by the good guy. Logan takes the many tropes of past superhero films and changes the narrative completely. Not only is the R rating strife for coarse language and savage violence throughout the film\, but it also allows us to see a truly gritty version of Hugh Jackman's iconic portrayal of the Marvel antihero. Loosely following the narrative in the Old Man Logan storyline in the comics\, we are thrust into a world where mutants are on a severe decline in numbers. This is due to a massive event involving Professor X developing seizures that cause intense moments of paralysis and eventually death and also the result of experimentation and disease created by various corporations wanting to expel the mutant race or create super soldiers for personal and national gain. These same super soldiers\, mere children scientifically and genetically modified within kidnapped Mexican teenagers\, are the crust of this film. In the year 2025\, Logan has attempted to disappear with Professor X in Mexico. However\, Logan needs to make money in order to sustain any type of lifestyle and to keep up the inventory of prescription drugs that are needed to quell the seizures that Charles suffers from and also to diminish his psychic abilities. During this time\, he is discovered by a woman attempting to flee with one of the aforementioned mutant children. This child just so happens to be the iconic X-23\, a hybrid mutant that shares a genetic code with Wolverine himself. With her dual claws coming out of her knuckles and a defensive claw in her feet\, she is a formidable killer. Add on her severe anger issues\, a la Wolverine himself\, and you have yourself one of the most deadly creatures ever. Witnessing their journey from Texas to the Canadian border\, dealing with the ever present threat of the pursuing Reavers and the manufactured monster X-24\, the fear of Professor X's seizures occurring and causing widespread chaos and death and of course just the volatile relationship the 2 clawed mutants share\, we are taken on a journey that threatens to change how we see superhero movies and how we feel about these characters. The truly epic deaths of both Professor X and Logan are heart-wrenching and leave you with a near empty feeling going forward. This film is amazing and needs to be seen by absolutely everyone. X-23 is masterfully portrayed by Dafne Keen and I would not be surprised if this character is continued on with her at the helm and the other mutant children playing important roles as well\, both as heroes and villains.",True,0.20279674232006073,0.21308138966560364,0.2021842747926712,0.2053617537021637,0.19030576944351196,0.19922468066215515,0.20103338360786438,0.19144539535045624,0.1912713348865509

The plot does not revolve around saving the world or alien invasion\, but surprisingly in the future when no one cares about mutants and they have to struggle in order to survive under the shadow of humanity\, redemption and heroism. In its long journey of 2 hours and 17 minutes\, the film is well-paced\, much darker\, gritty\, fun\, full with brutal explosion of violence and action sequences but also emotional most of the time without impressive costumes or big demonstrations of superpower. Unlike previous installments on Wolverine\, Jackman portrays Logan as a faded prime superhero with depth of emotions while the touching performance from Stewart as Xavier and other supporting casts have overall matched the intention of director Mangold's to defy the genre convention - somberness that DC Dawn of Justice fails to achieve previously.

122104,Logan,2017-11-17,5,"From the opening title its clear Logan is a different sort of superhero movie.  I don't even mean the R-rated gore and language\, I just mean the tone.  It shows us a pretty hopeless future and an even more hopeless Logan.  This isn't the badass from the other movies\, this is a man at the end.  That attitude pervades through the whole movie.  It's incredible\, there are action scenes in this movie but it's definitely not an action movie in the same sense of the other X-Men movies and most other superhero movies in general.  It feels more like an independent film\, a road trip with some hopeless people who don't really like each other but do care about each other and are stuck together.  It actually reminded me a lot of Children of Men in both its plot structure and overall tone.  Both movies are about hopeless people reluctantly put on a final mission that will give them a final bit of purpose and refuel their hope.  Children of Men is one of my favorite films of all time\, but there is one bit of an edge I have to give Logan: the history.  The X-Men movie timeline is convoluted as all hell\, but the fact remains we have known this character for 17 years now\, so right from the get-go he has an advantage over Clive Owen in Children of Men.  Strangely though that does give my one big criticism of the movie\, which is how it fits in with the rest of the X-Men movies.  If you really start thinking about how it fits into the overall timeline it starts to get confusing and depressing.  The idea that this is ultimately where the current movie timeline will end up is incredibly depressing.  But as a stand-alone movie\, it's magnificent.\nI don't even know how to address all my praise for this movie.  Patrick Stewart gives an amazing performance as a broken down Professor X whose losing his mind\, and newcomer Dafne Keen gives a rage-filled powerhouse performance.  I think a lot of people are going to compare her to Eleven from Stranger Things\, but Eleven's awesome\, and to be fair X-23 came first.  She's also far more brutal than Eleven\, fitting with the whole movie.  The R-rating and gratuitous language and violence actually feel organic to the whole thing.  For one\, it's a much more brutal world now than the world of the past films.  Also\, most of the violence doesn't feel like much more than the same violence that was occurring just off-screen in the past films.  It's just now rather than panning away\, the camera stays there.\nThis is that rare sort of superhero movie that transcends it's genre.  It's a powerful roadtrip drama with an indie edge and a couple of characters who just happen to have superpowers.  It's brutal\, heartbreaking\, and often quite moving.  The final 10 minutes of the movie are full of the feels\, and damn it all if I didn't start tearing up a bit.  For comic book fun\, it's probably not the best choice.  For a character-driven drama with a couple ultra-violent action scenes\, it's incredible.",True,0.7369585037231445,0.7273861765861511,0.6429736614227295,0.7128483653068542,0.7061406970024109,0.7371429204940796,0.6497795581817627,0.7113003134727478,0.7171454429626465
122120,Logan,2017-01-19,5,"From the very start it is very clear that this is a very very different take on not only Marvel's merry mutants but of the superhero genre in general.

This is a real dying art these days with most genre pics and best picture pics opting for even the name of the movie appearing right at the end or a title card following a teaser sequence. Logan is of a different age though evoking 'Shane' which it references anyway and 'Unforgiven'. Killers drifting outside of society wondering where it all went wrong. It's also part road movie taking the best bits of the Mad Max and Terminator franchises. Although prior knowledge is not essential - not the case with this reviewer - it does however heighten the X-perience. After all we have seen Jackman and Stewart in their roles for 17 years now - far far longer than most contemporaries - and there have been countless versions of Spidey\, Bats and Supes. What distances itself from the Marvel Cinematic Universe is that lives are at stake - real danger and brutality. For all of Civil War being a game changer essentially Iron Man and Cap will be friends again. Logan is a different beast. It's rather a pity that this comes out now as it misses the OSCAR season - Jackman a nom? Or Stewart for best supporting?

I felt like there was a great movie trapped in a so-so movie's shell.

I felt like the film's main purpose was to say \""fuck\"" as many times as humanly possible. This made the dialogue weak overall -- and beyond being weak\, the dialogue lacked character details which could have been added had the filmmakers chosen not to distract us with so many curse words.

First Split\, John Wick 2 and Get Out has solidified this year for a good 1st quarter.\nLogan does a great job of feeling like an independent or Oscar worthy film. The performance and the atmosphere is great. Logan takes place in a not so distant future where Mutants have become extinct. The last of the mutants have been in exile. Logan is a limo driver\, his powers are deteriorating\, along with Professor X. Both Jackman and Stewart do a tremendous job at portraying the aging mutants.

It is satisfying to see how brutal the main character is. The film is bloody but not over the top gory in a sense that it abuses the R-Rating.

The violence is needed to adapt the story however it is the tone and the situations that make this a mature film.

Cartoony violence has been replaced with bloody\, graphic violence and the standard PG-13 superhero dialogue has been replaced with F-Bombs left\, right and center. At first\, the excessive swearing felt extremely forced. Every second word out of Wolverine's mouth was F this and F that. Not to mention that Charles Xavier even dropped some F-Bombs.  It seemed like the writers were like\, \""Yes! We have an R rating now! Let's see how many F-Bombs we can shove into this thing!\"" Thankfully\, over the course of the movie\, the swearing seemed more natural. I should also note that this movie is depressing. Good god\, this movie is sad. The premise is that all your favourite X-Men are dead and arguably the two main members of the X-Men are old and dying. Depressing as it is\, it did raise the stakes significantly. Wolverine isn't this indestructible wrecking force anymore. He is weak\, slow\, and old which\, by default\, makes the opposition just that much stronger. Speaking of the antagonists\, this movie started off with a pretty good one. Boyd Holbrook plays the evil Pierce. This guy would have been a great villain until they pull the \""Oh... he's just working for someone else. He's just the muscle.\"" card. Not to mention that when we meet who he is actually working for\, he is boring. So the antagonists are kind of weak in terms of character. That's the only real fault I can think of in this movie\, other than it is much slower than any of the other X-Men movies. What makes this movie work and stand above the rest is the over-the-top action and the addition of Dafne Keen as the little Laura (or as I like to call her Wolverine Junior). It's really menacing when a 10-year-old girl can take down an entire S.W.A.T. team and not say a single word. Not only can she play a great bad-ass\, but she captures the sweet curious innocence of a mutant that is so lost in the world and her only hope of survival is Logan and Charles Xavier. The kid knocks it out of the park. She reminds me of the boy from The Shining. Their acting completely from just their facial expressions and their gaze.

128959,Logan,2017-03-10,5,"Hugh Jackman brings the curtain down on his time as Wolverine with this terrific final installment.\nIn the near future\, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X somewhere on the Mexican border. However\, Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are upended when a young mutant arrives\, pursued by dark forces.\nAfter 17 years of on screen berserker antics that have ranged from the good (X-Men\, X2) to the bad (X-men Days of Future Past) to the downright ugly (X-men Origins: Wolverine) fans of the character have finally been given the film they always wanted. \nThe violence on display here is staggering. Limbs are removed\, Heads are stabbed\, blood flows and f bombs are dropped. This puts most horror films to shame in the blood & gore department. \nBut although the film has the violence the fans have craved it also has heart. Based loosely on the Old Man Logan storyline the film finds a broken Logan and a fragile Xavier hiding in Mexico in a desolate future where Mutants have been eradicated. Xavier is suffering from dementia and is prone to psychic outbursts that can injure hundreds (it's hinted that one of these attacks before this story had tragic consequences).\nThe introduction of a young Mutant similar to Logan himself set these characters on a desperate journey that may finally bring Logan some purpose to his bruised and battered existence. \nJackman is on fine form here. Logan is now extremely unwell slowly dying from something never explained\, his healing factor not what it was. He takes a beating here and Jackman plays weary well.\nPatrick Stewart is again brilliant. Xavier is a desperate ailing man and his portrayal is moving infact so moving it may bring a few long time fans to tears.\nThe villan has a good villan too in the shape of Boyd Holbrook. His character is both menacing and comedic and he acquits himself well. Kudos too to newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura the young mutant who is as lethal as the title character. \nAs mentioned before the film is violent and has a number of thrilling action scenes with the climax really kicking ass.\nDirector James Mangold & screenwriter Scott Frank deserve massive credit for finally doing a Wolverine film right and well done also to 20th Century Fox for having the gall to produce this. With Logan and the brilliant Deadpool last year they are quickly cornering the market for R rated comic book adaptations and doing something different to the MCU.\nThis is a fitting swam song for the character and bloody comic book romp.\nIt's sad that Jackman has hung up the claws after 17 years but wow what a way to finish.",True,0.5438419580459595,0.543032169342041,0.5095714330673218,0.5364060401916504,0.5202052593231201,0.5329684019088745,0.48958566784858704,0.5203066468238831,0.5329129695892334

Jackman brings his all to the role\, turning in easily his best\, deepest and most complex performance\, proving he has a lot more to bring to the part than just bulging muscles and lots of shouting. It might go on a bit long and be pretty morose at times\, but the seriousness of the film never bothered me because I believed the danger\, I understood the risks and I knew how bleak the situations presented truly were. The whole film has a very 'Our world is collapsing around us' vibe\, and as the characters struggle for survival\, run for safety and search for answers\, it's clear how far the series has come from the relatively child friendly original. The R-rated is essential to the films impact\, and had it been PG-13 it would have utterly neutered it. There's a real brutal\, kinetic feel in the fights scenes\, which are violent but not gratuitous\, at least most of the tine\, and fact that the characters no longer have restrictions on what they say gives us a closer insight into their true feelings. It's a serious film\, a dark film\, a film that doesn't sugar-coat and doesn't take the easy route. The action scenes\, while suffering from too many disposable henchmen spoiling the broth\, are exciting and well assembled\, the fights are hard hitting and\, for the most part\, comprehensible\, and the principle characters\, especially Logan\, are given a chance to be as real as they can be.

Logan is set in an unforgivingly brutal world where hope is nowhere to be found and bleakness fogs the life of our protagonist. Despite this Logan sets out towards the horizon in search of a safe haven if not for himself\, for Laura played wildly by Dafne Keen.\n\nHe maybe at wits end but there is a spark of kindness that fuels his rage-filled journey packed with blood\, death and devastation and that is more than enough for Logan to push forward with all odds stacked against him.

129009,Logan,2017-03-12,4,"Hugh Jackman returns one final time as Wolverine in Logan. Logan is pretty old now. He still has his powers\, but his speed\, strength and recovery powers have diminished quite a bit with age. In a fight in the opening scene he is not even able to fully release his 3 claws at even length. He spends his time now driving clients around in a limo car. He also tends to the aging professor X reprised by Patrick Stewart. \n\nThere is a bump in his daily routines when a young Hispanic woman asks here to take her and a girl north to a sanctuary in North Dakota. She and everyone else around her soon winds up dead\, and Logan is left with the girl. After large band of henchman tries to dispose of them all\, Wolverine has no choice but to take them north. Their mutant friend keeps tracking them and the henchmen follow and kill everyone along the way to catch Wolverine and the girl. Wolverine feels obligated as he finds out the girl is a mutant created from his DNA and has similar powers. \n\nLogan is an excellent conclusion to the X-Men series for Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. The two arguably were the best casted X-Men and they finally get a really good film that they can both shine in. Hugh Jackman gives his best all-around performance as Wolverine and is able to display his range as an actor. Stewart does a great job as the aged professor that is more of a danger others than helpful and he provides much of the comic relief in the film. The film runs a little long and some points the chase gets slightly repetitive. The Wolverine clone was really the worst addition to the film as this has been done far too often in films and its getting tiring. The Rated R action gives the film a great edge as many of the deaths are quite violent at the death of Wolverines hands. Because the mutant daughter has the same powers there is not a huge variety in the kills. The film's really strength is the emotional element the characters are able to display as they bond together and eventually see their last days.

The torment Logan goes through is so sad because the thing that has helped him for the past seventeen years is poisoning him and he doesn't heal fully from the scars.

The score is amazing and it elevates so many scenes and I loved the score. The sound design with all of the powers and the logans claws it sounds so good with the moments when Logan gets mad and brings his claws out sounds so good.

But after 17 years\, it seems that the X-Men property is about to be rebooted due to the critical and commercial disappointment that was \""X-Men Apocalypse\"" and the humongous success that \""Deadpool\"" was\, so it seems fitting that Jackman decided to call it a day as Wolverine by giving fans what they have demand for years: An R rated Wolverine film. Is \""Logan\"" as good as many claim it is? \n\nIn 2029\, mutant are at the edge of extinction as no mutant has been born in 25 years (a la \""Children of Men\"").

But the problems this film has are both directing and writing. Mangold's directing is so lackluster on the character moments as they come off as hollow\, but he is still committed on making them work thus creating pacing problems. The script is so predictable\, full of recycled ideas\, it goes for the lowest common denominator as not only does it spoon feeds the audience but it tries so hard to be sentimental and it fails spectacularly\, and it is quite lazy at times (starting from the fact that Wolverine now has Itachi disease).

The best superhero movie?\n\nAnswer: All of the above.\n\nIrrespective of whether you agree or disagree with me on that\, what you will agree on is the fact that Logan is the X-Men movie us fans deserve.\n\nNo\, it does not have excessive violence like some critics are saying. In fact\, for the first time\, it has appropriate amount of violence an X-Men movie is supposed to have. X-Men movies were never meant to be PG-13. The comics have always been R rated\, and the movies should also be R rated. And thanks to Deadpool\, for the first time 20th Century Fox has allowed it to be so. \n\nSo if you move past the violence\, you will see that director James Mangold has paid attention to small details. Like when Wolverine stabs someone\, the claws come out from the other side. There is blood splatter. And yes\, the wounds heal\, but the blood stains remain. Details like these makes Logan the much needed and munch deserved X-Men movie for us fans. \n\nLogan is not your usual superhero movie. It is dark\, yet poetic. The world is not getting destroyed by Aliens or Supervillains here. This is a more intimate\, personal and human story. And that is such a welcome change. The cinematography immaculately captures the loneliness of this broken Logan. The action sequences are choreographed rhythmically and showcase Logan's anger and frustration. And the special effects are just top notch. The editing is seamless and helps the screenplay to flow. \n\nIt is set in the near future\, where Logan is now old\, not healing as fast\, but there is still fire in him. It's dim\, but it's still lethal. He is keeping it alive to take care of Charles. And to ignite that fire comes X-23. Who is she? Why does she needs Logan's protection? Who are the bad guys after her? To get answers to these questions you will have to go see Logan.

But the movie sets itself so much to be a great send off for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine\, it succeeds in showing you a huge story arch for that one character and no real plot for anything else. The threat to mutants still exists\, the girl who needs a father figure has to settle for a grumpy chauffeur instead. And now the universe set up in the film shall carry on as usual. The antagonists here seem to just be playful obstacles that entertain us with many sharp objects going through faces. But they seem very non-threatening to the likes of the two most powerful mutants in the X-men franchise. They even take a step back as the child X-23 growls in front of them. There is a bigger more recognisable baddie that comes to destroy wolverine in the end\, showing us some deep symbolism of Logan's inner battles.. but it also just looks like an over the top grande finale for Hugh Jackman.

Even the notion of developing hybrid species in the bellies of poor Mexican women does not sound too futuristic. Hence the use of young children as soldiers (and as the precursors for future series of X-Men)\, the most disturbing part of the film yet\, the role of Laura\, Logan's alleged child and little assassin.

This is what it's all come to. There is a sweeping sorrow to Hugh Jackman's swan song as The Wolverine\, but much like its brutal\, bloody\, and exceptionally R-rated violence\, this tone feels justified and necessary. Necessary not only in the aesthetic sense of what is befitting to Logan's world\, but necessary in that tragedy always was the way of the world for Logan AKA James Howlett\, so why might his conclusion be spared such tribulations? Fortunately for us\, but unfortunately for our titular mutant LOGAN is another tale in which our protagonist is pulled into a conflict in which he bears no responsibility in creating\, but that his storied past has somehow served as an influence and thus he is then unwillingly pulled into the scenario. This time things are different though\, as before and in the many movies we've seen Jackman portray Wolverine the character has always been reluctant\, but ultimately unable to deny his true and selfless heroism. He couldn't help but to care\, couldn't help but to stand up for the little guy and what he felt to be right\, but in LOGAN Wolverine is a much more broken man than we've ever seen him before. His extended past is beginning to catch up with him and we can see that he's tired of playing this role\, he's tired of being the hero\, of feeling the responsibility to save the day and that he's essentially forcing himself to not care any longer\, but rather focus on the task at hand-a task that sees putting himself and an old friend first. In the midst of all this is the centerpiece that is Jackman's final turn as the adamantium clawed mutant making this grief and misery and pain all the more palpable. Jackman so embodies the character at this point though\, it's hard to imagine he has a hard time slipping into even the worn and weathered skin of his alter ego at this stage in the game. And while it is Jackman's (presumably) final turn in his most iconic role that is rightly at the center of what makes LOGAN so emotionally rich and narratively compelling there is plenty going on around him that builds the film up in these ways and make it a genuinely thrilling end of an era. \n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",True,0.5169503688812256,0.47392919659614563,0.37881767749786377,0.5101456642150879,0.32099631428718567,0.4122639298439026,0.4173462688922882,0.5075756907463074,0.5260615944862366

By going some place new-taking a superhero film into our noir film past-AND by updating noir to a sensationally popular series-AND by bringing noir into the 21st century\, this one is spectacular.

It didn't exactly reach my expectations but it was still an amazing movie. Characters were great\, performances were great\, and it was emotionally strong at times. X-23 (Dafne Keen) stole the show for me. Can't wait to see her in more X-Men films and more movies not X-Men wise.

Logan (Hugh Jackman) is facing his own mortality and is making a living as a chauffeur driving\, whilst looking after Professor X (Patrick Stewart) who is suffering from seizures which cause everyone around him to become paralysed.  However\, as often happens Logan can't stay hidden for long and trouble finds him when he encounters a young girl named Laura who has possesses similar mutant powers to his own and she is being hunted by a gang of mercenaries known as the Reavers.  \n\nWith the success of Deadpool\, Sony allowed director James Mangold the freedom to create a Wolverine film closer in tone to the source material and what we get is a brutal and visceral film and serves up violence rarely seen in this genre of film.  Although at first\, the swearing seems out of place\, the film soon settles down and you adjust to the new tone that shares more with the likes of Mad Max and the recent Hell or High Water than it does with any of the previous X-Men films.  Unlike previous outings\, Wolverine is seen in full beast mode\, slashing and dicing anyone who tries to stop him and although often bloody\, the violence is never gratuitous.\n\nAs mentioned above\, the girl Logan encounters shares his abilities and is played magnificently by newcomer Dafne Keen and her performance is even more amazing considering she spends most of the film mute.\n\nTo counter the violence there are also moments of pathos in the film as Logan is realising his body his breaking down and he doesn't heal as fast as he used to and there's an especially touching scene when Logan\, Professor X and Laura share a dinner with a family that the trio stopped to help on the freeway.\n\nIf this is the last time we see Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart as these characters this is definitely a fitting send off.",True,0.35653385519981384,0.39913254976272583,0.16546931862831116,0.34011685848236084,0.022150885313749313,0.3428884446620941,0.08129262179136276,0.334351509809494,0.39631879329681396

145867,Logan,2017-03-20,5,"I've been wanting to see this in the few weeks and yes it is quite good but what I am not expecting is I've had a reaction to Deadpool appearing in the opening but that wasn't the case of it. I was expecting to see a 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning\, but no\, it's just the trailer of the new Deadpool movie coming out next year. It's not the opening scene where you can see the Deadpool character\, it's just the trailer. I have seen the film\, Deadpool but I wasn't expecting to see him breaking the fourth wall. OK\, I know you're thinking I'm going off track of this review but that's just the thought on the opening before the film is starting. Logan is a film released this year 2017 before the live-action Beauty and the Beast. Me and Dad had been watching last week on Saturday and yes\, I wasn't expecting to see Deadpool at the beginning (which is a trailer new film coming out next year) before the 20th Century Fox logo is coming. I just hope the Marvel logo in the recent films and films next year would stay in the very beginning just like all studio logos did. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart reprised their roles one last time in the most recent film of the X-Men franchise because this is the last film that Hugh Jackman playing Logan as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Hugh Jackman's performance is fantastic\, Patrick Stewart's character is in the wheelchair and this kid I don't know who she is and I've never seen her before in my life and also Stephen Merchant is in this. I actually liked this film despite it's violence with blood and guts which is unexpected for an X-Men. Actually liked it so did my Dad and was left blown away by it. I was telling my Dad that why does it have blood and huts when all the other X-Men films didn't and he says ''Well\, it's because the filmmakers wanted to make something different and making it 18\, 15 and 12 and rated PG\, PG-13 and R making it for kids and adults especially teenagers.'' I know that this movie is going to be rated R at first before the film is released. When we're watching it I was thinking to myself ''this doesn't even seem like an X-Men movie.'' With this movie it is something that people watch and they and I didn't expect to see which direction is going. I know about the plot twists and I think this film is absolutely fantastic. And I guess this is the last X-Men film to be made and of course Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are their last roles and I still haven't seen the new X-Men films\, X-Men: First Class\, The Wolverine\, X-Men: Days of Future Past and X-Men: Apocalypse and yes I have seen the old one's and I think this is the only R rated movie I've ever watched in cinema's.

145974,Logan,2017-03-03,2,"I've never liked Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I grew up with the comics and the X-men cartoon on Saturday mornings. I like Jackman as an actor\, just not in that role. Something about a 6'2\"" lean build just doesn't look right for the character or fit with its personality. \n\nWe saw the movie Logan today. It was ok\, but not anything that can be confused for good. As with all of the Wolverine movies there doesn't seem to be any continuity with them. They are each their own little independent adventure.\n\nX-men Origins: Wolverine - Wolverine attends a reunion \nThe Wolverine - Wolverine goes to Japan. \nThe Prestige - Wolverine becomes a magician (costarring Batman with a cameo by Jareth the Goblin King)\nReal Steel - Wolverine's adventure with Robot Boxing\nEddie the Eagle - Wolverine teaches Alan Ford to ski\nLogan - National Lampoons: X-men vacation\n\nIt works for an episode of Rick and Morty. Not so much for this. \n\nWith Logan its like Fox put out a survey asking what people wanted in a X-men movie and received the response that people want a movie that is more in line with the comics while not being marketed to children. They reacted to this by making an exceptionally violent movie (\""hey\, it worked for Deadpool?\"") while also referencing the content of the comics as just \""comics\"" and thus only part of the canon in the sense that they're a whimsical depiction of the \""real\"" X-men that are featured in the films. I interpret this as Fox flipping the bird to people wishing for them to embrace the comics in the same way that Marvel has. That's kind of ironic given how all of the Avengers films have been solid\, while X-men First Class and (maybe) Days of Future Past are the only decent offerings of what is now 9 X-men related films (Deadpool is kind of off doing its own thing) by the studio.

The film instead is more like a dramatic piece. It has edges and flows and feels powerful. Every scene in it feels more impactful than the last.\n\nTruly if superhero films keep getting this good it won't be long till the Academy Awards wakes up and has to nominate one of them for best picture.

It felt completely different as a film with the character like the style\, direction\, and tone. Different in a good way\, were James Mangold's direction was worth mentioning and how this character was so grim looking. The film given an R rated direction\, makes it even gritty when it comes to its brutal bloody violence and a more profane Wolverine. Logan is an impressive film that could stand on its own if it wanted too. The script was perfect as it focuses on the characterization with a grim old alcoholic Wolverine and gritty intense fight sequences that can leave the audience cringing with the characters claws slicing through the bad guys. \n\nThe plot takes place in 2026\, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a chauffeur for hire\, driving his clients in a dystopian future. Trying to make enough money for him and Charles (Patrick Stewart) to live on their own and away from everyone. Until a lady asks Logan for help\, knowing who he really is. And needs his help to drive Laura (Dafne Keen) from the borders of Mexico to North Dakota for safe haven. With a militarized unit known as the Reavers led by Donald (Boyd Holbrook) after them. Laura has a similar gift like Wolverine with the claws and a healing factor. \n\nThe plot was well done\, taking the story further out with the timeline\, making Logan feeling isolated and alone. With the adamantium poisoning him as he ages\, and it is finally catching up to him. The film has some gritty intense action sequences making Wolverine fights with the bad guys bloody. The film's midway reveal with the villain was also cool and puts an insane match to Wolverine without giving away spoilers.  \n\nHugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart delivered their best as their characters are older and a grimmer look. Dafne Keen did great as Laura\, a quiet young girl that delivers expressions that you can actually feel for when she is afraid or angry. \n\nLogan does so well in concluding Wolverine's character arc\, and even though it is sad to see this being the final movie to the character. It did it so well\, that Logan ends in an emotional satisfying way. I still have trouble seeing how this movie is so different from the others. The others focused too much on having a lot of mutant characters and action and cgi. This film worked on delivering just on that one character\, less cgi action. Grittier undertone action. Sometimes taking it way to seriously for a comic book character. Which makes this character different from the previous movies and the X-Men movies. \n\nOverall\, Logan is a really good superhero film\, making it the best in the series.

147374,Logan,2017-03-12,1,"I went to see Logan on opening night because I have been a fan of marvel since the first Spiderman and X-men movies were released.  Growing up\, I collected the various marvel comic books that are now the popular block buster movies this generation has come to love.  When I read the early reviews of Logan\,  I naturally assumed that the movie would chronicle the original storyline of Logan\, a.k.a. Wolverine\, and open the door for the New Mutants that were trained by the originally X-men.  One of the coolest thing about Wolverine character was that he was immortal because his body would regenerate and quickly heal\, fight off any infection\, etc.  This leads me to my first complaint of the new movie.  Logan's claim to fame is that he was originally \""selected\"" by Striker as the subject to receive an indestructible metal infused skeleton because his body would naturally heal and adapt to the skeleton rather than dying during the process of infusion.  In this movie\, Logan is getting older and dying because of the metal infused skeleton he had lived and thrived with for 60 plus years or more.  To add to this confusion\, the little girl in the movie\, (Logan's daughter) is cloned using Logan's DNA.  The cloning process is completed by the government.  (Why would the government of Mexico choose to clone a weapon that is getting sick and dying?)  Also\,  there are so many things about the movie that make the audience guess or wonder how the main characters got to that point in their lives.  Basically\, the main character development skips A\,B\,C\,D\,E\,F\, and goes straight to G.  Xavier is an old\, crazed cripple who lives in an abandoned water tower and is fed medication to keep him groggy and asleep.  Logan is an aged chauffeur that works for drugs.  The year is supposedly 2027 and Logan's car looks futuristic\, yet the rest of the vehicles in the scenes driving on the streets etc. look very \""non-futuristic\"" and are simply vehicles seen on the roads today.  In the end\, everyone dies sad and alone except the kids who end up being\, well\, sad and alone.  No redemption\, no happiness.

147488,Logan,2017-03-02,5,"I will start by saying that this is my new all time favorite superhero film ever created and this is the first time it has changed since the 2002 version of Spider-Man. I mean \""Logan\"" had it all. The story takes place in the year 2029 with a bruised and battered Logan trying to make a living while helping out an aging and decrepit Xavier. The story then turns towards Logan being tasked to help X-23. I will stop there as to not spoil anything in the least. I will continue onto the acting with both Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Xavier giving the most awe-inspiring performances of their careers as these characters which have been 17 years in the making since their on-screen adaptations have emerged. The newest star Dafne Keen as Luara/X-23 did an outstanding job and Boyd Holbrook as Donal Pierce was a BADASS. The acting all around was a Masterpiece. The action is what most people are going to go and watch this movie for in my opinion and it doesn't disappoint. The action is gritty\, gore-filled and gratuitous and I may add that it had a sort-of mesmerizing effect throughout the entire movie. The action was enthralling and the fact that most of it was done without the use of CG makes it even more fascinating. The cinematography is uncompromising and very surreal and each shot is done with such integrity for the craft that it can't help but be noticed thanks to James Mangold. I will close by saying this is a Must-Watch film. The film is filled with subtle nuances and nods to the old while bringing what is surely to be the new to the forefront. The film has a good amount of humor and also a heartfelt embrace that is soon never to be forgotten for as long as you live. P.S.

147821,Logan,2017-03-09,5,"James Mangold's \""Logan\"" is a true masterpiece of the comic book genre\, a film that pushes boundaries and feeling like it's combining the style and moment-driven beauty of a Zack Snyder film and the story-driven passion of a Chris Nolan picture. An emotional roller-coaster with intense but grounded action\, that's the polar opposite of what Fox gave us with \""Deadpool\"".    \n\nDafne Keen gives the strongest performance seen on screen by a child since \""Looper\"" and is more than a match for her counterparts Jackman and Stewart\, stealing almost every scene she's in. As for Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman's performances you get everything you expect and more from actors who have had 17 years of being their characters. It's passionate\, precise\, emotional\, and timeless - leaving their stamp on the silver screen thanks to the writing team of Mangold\, Scott Frank\, and Michael Green. \n\nWonderfully edited- which has seemed to be a problem lately for these types of films- the structural editing seems flawless\, constantly keeping the viewer locked into each scene\, keeping you aware of where you are\, who is involved\, and everyone's emotions.

Who knew that as soon as CG could simulate life convincingly it would immediately become boring to look at?

It also helps that you finally get to hear Hugh Jackman's character curse like a sailor. While certainly transcending the genre in terms of character development\, action sequences\, and plotting\, the film is still entrenched in the comic book universe. If you had no background with X-Men you would understand most of what is going on through actual storytelling\, but by no means is it a standalone film\, as the lackluster \""Deadpool 2\"" teaser intro will demonstrate. The aesthetic is intentionally unlike the rest of the franchise\, holding more in common with \""No Country for Old Men\"" than last year's \""Apocalypse\"". But more than either of those movies\, it carries the torch of ultra-violence in the vein of \""Robocop\"" or any given Mel Gibson flick.

The film is set many years after the events of the previous films in the year 2029. Logan is older and his powers aren't quite what they used to be. It hurts for his claws to come out\, he doesn't heal as quick anymore and is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning. He spends his days driving a limo and taking care of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is suffering from Alzheimers and ALS. Logan protects the Professor who is suffering from seizures that can hurt the people around him. They all have little contact other than the mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant) who helps when Logan is away. One day Logan is approached by a lady named Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) who has a young girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) with her and beg Logan to take them across the country to a place where mutants can be safe called Eden. After a series of events Logan\, Professor Xavier and Laura are on the run from a malicious man named Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) who will stop at nothing to get Laura back. What's the mystery of Laura and how does she connect to Logan? Well I'm not gonna spoil everything\, but the trailers say most of it. Right off the bat this movie is brutal! It is a hard R rating with a ton of gore\, but it finally fits the character of Wolverine finally and truer to the comics. Hugh Jackman is brilliant in his last go around and his interactions with Stewart and Keen are really well done. There's always been such a good chemistry between Stewart and Jackman over the last 17 years and it's one of those things I'll miss.

He brought a unique personality to a very interesting and complicated character that I do not think any other actor could have done as well.

It's more intimate than the traditional superhero picture too. Director James Mangold strips the production of unnecessary flourishes. Occasionally it pauses to reflect on age and one's own mortality. That's such a rarity it has caused some critics to elevate this to the status of greatest superhero film ever made. Let's all just calm down now a bit shall we?  Anyone who saw the narratively similar Midnight Special knows an introspective study about people has been done before and better\, but I'll give Logan points for trying at least.

It was quite the rollercoaster and the tip of the cherry comes from the emotionally charged moments between Logan and Charles. It becomes a character study. A film that focuses on relationships and the connection between one person to another.

The story in Logan continues the theme of mutants that's similar to many pass X-Men films but portrayed in a different way. What's most affecting in this film is the way it touches humanity in mutants like Logan and Charles\, their characters especially are really what makes this film a masterpiece and therefore this film's most prominent aspect is the character study and development.

There couldn't have been a better way to conclude the story\, on its own terms\, that bids a solemn farewell to the character. The grittiness\, the violence and the melancholic withdrawal\, all were thoughtfully used to craft this flick that so majestically defied the burdens of its genre.

I noticed Boyd Holbrook for the first time after Narcos\, and he played it cool. I commend director James Mangold's efforts to helm this project.

150375,Logan,2017-03-24,5,"Logan is a powerful and emotional take on the superhero genre. While as most of the superhero movies out today and upcoming are more focused on bringing an entertaining superhero movie (which is fine)\, Logan gives a depressing and bleak look at one of the X-Men's most popular member\, Wolverine. Now Wolverine is an old man and has to take care of Professor X who is suffering from a degenerative brain disease. When Logan is approached by a woman to take care of a young girl\, he is reluctant to do so\, as a shady man who works for an evil organization is looking for the young girl (X-23). This movie has elements of a game called The Last of Us and resembles it quite so in a lot of places. But the movie offers an amazing look at the character of Logan and what he's become. The violence in this movie is brutal. And what's different here with the killing and violence than in Deadpool is that the death and killing means something. Killing takes away some of his soul and that's why he's reluctant to use his claws. This movie has a powerful metaphor for PTSD where Logan is suffering from nightmares\, and is very depressed and is trying to escape from everything. I honestly can't think of something bad that this movie gave me. It's a very very depressing movie and is a FANTASTIC sendoff for the character of Wolverine.

We are told that no mutants have been born for 20 years and apparently most have been killed or have dies but the government has been playing around with mutant DNA and have used it to impregnate poor Mexican women in order to use the resultant children as super soldiers. A dying Logan and a nonagenarian Charles Xavier set out on a road trip with one of these children\, hunted\, not by some super villain\, but by some US government agency. Brilliant and lyrical the film has some of the most brutal and brilliantly choreographed fight scenes I've seen. It has been hailed as a fitting end to Hugh Jackman's 17 year span in the role of Logan the Wolverine but it is surely also the end of Patrick Stewart's 17 year reign as Charles Xavier\, Professor X. Both actors have inhabited these roles perfectly and although the film is Logan's it's a great tribute to both actors and both of the characters they have played so well.

The film takes place in the year 2029\, when augmented humans\, known as Mutants\, are on the verge of extinction. Logan\, a mutant who is nigh indestructible\, must live in secret in his old age to keep himself and his friends alive. Logan's life is further complicated when he meets a young girl who is said to be one of the few mutants born in the last 25 years. Together\, they must find their way to safety when a bounty hunter attempts to capture both of them\, beginning a long chase across the country.\n\nWhile I appreciated this movie from a technical standpoint\, I was a little underwhelmed when it came to the story. The performances given by Hugh Jackman\, Patrick Stewart\, and Dafne Keen were all excellent. I really felt for these characters and believed the emotions they were attempting to portray on screen. Patrick Stewart did a particularly excellent job in his portrayal of an elderly man with Alzheimer's. The beginning of the movie really feels as though it's building to something big\, but after the second action scene\, the movie felt to me as if it almost ground to a halt. There is a good 30 to 40 minutes of this movie that's basically only road-trip. While this does lead to good character development\, light comedy\, and decent exposition\, I felt my interest really begin to wane around the middle of this film.\nOn the whole\, there is plenty of action\, but there are large gaps where very little happens. This movie earns its R rating so leave the kids at home or find something else to do with them. In my opinion\, it's not a bad movie\, but it just lacks focus.

Hugh Jackman once again proves why he was the perfect fit for the character. It's not just Logan either\, it applies to Charles as well. Seeing Charles with alzheimer's (I apologize if that's misspelled) reminds me that he's human too\, mutant or not. I would explain more\, but I'd rather you see for yourself.\n\nLogan is not a superhero movie. It only takes place in a superhero universe. The characters aren't trying to save the world. There is no apocalyptic future at stake. These characters may be mutant\, but they are also human\, dealing with problems that combine both of those aspects and seem almost like they are real. Logan is not a hero\, he is a man\, a man dealing with many struggles\, internal and external\, due to the events of his exotic past.

The world is near apocalyptic\, mutants are dying out\, and everything is very\, very brown. It doesn't take long to see that this story is quite different from the blockbusters that preceded it.

Unfortunately\, Logan\, is profoundly more tragic than films such as: Titanic\, or Terms of Endearment. Being that the theme of family is heavily ingrained in the film\, it speaks of two men; Logan(Wolverine) and Charles(Professor X)\, former X-MEN. Who in this point of time in the film have lost their former family(The X-MEN) and are now alone and have gone into hiding. Despite their both vulnerable state\, they ultimately decide to use their fading mutant powers to help a young new mutant(X-23) to safety. In the process\, develop their own new trio family. This reoccurring theme of family in the film\, heavily foreshadows the X-MEN\, and that is where the ultimate tragedy is.

150640,Logan,2017-02-13,2,"Logan - Touted as a sci-fi western\, it definitely lived up to the moniker. Far-reaching deserts and a minimalist score really set the stage. James Mangold wrote and directed it\, but I wish he had put down the pen. Each scene is thoughtfully shot\, but it's the story within those shots that left me wanting.\nThe positives for me\, beyond the ambiance\, were two standout performances by under the radar actors. Stephen Merchant\, who is usually in English sitcoms\, went way off type with his character. Given his past roles I thought it was an odd casting choice at best\, but now I couldn't picture anyone else doing what he did. The other was Boyd Holbrook\, who played the main antagonist. The subtle choices he made in line delivery and how he carried himself made him a magnetic presence onscreen. The film was much more engaging while they were involved in a scene.\nAnd then there are the negatives...As I alluded to earlier\, the story was just not there. There's weak motivation throughout for both Wolverine and the villains. The movie creates its own plot holes unnecessarily and leans on tropes and off screen happenings to propel it along.\nThe action scenes are an exercise in redundancy. Slash this guy\, stab that guy\, try stabbing and slashing this person\, now mix it up a bit and slash THEN stab this guy. Once you see the first fight you'll have seen them all.\nAnd finally there are the inconsistencies with the special effects. They could create extremely detailed battle damage\, but couldn't remove the prominent scar on the forehead of the self-healing girl. They could green screen prosthetic arms for multiple characters\, but couldn't remove the reflection of the camera in peoples' sunglasses.

150670,Logan,2017-03-04,3,"Logan was directed by James Mangold (Wolverine) and stars Hugh Jackman in his final appearance as Logan A.K.A. Wolverine\, one of the last remaining mutants and caretaker of Professor Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart). Fate finds Logan and Charles needing to deliver a mysterious young girl with powers similar to Logan to the Canadian border where other new young mutants are fleeing.\n\nNo matter the quality of the X-Men film he stars in\, Hugh Jackman personifies Logan perfectly. His performance in this movie is nothing short of Oscar-worthy\, and I'm not exaggerating. The emotional depth and toil his character has gone through is devastating\, and his arc of redemption is inspiring. Not to be forgotten is Sir Patrick Stewart's final performance as Professor X. This was a very different Charles than we've seen\, and\, without giving anything away\, it worked.\n\nLogan is also the first X-Men movie (not including Deadpool) to be rated R\, and this could have been a negative. It was a risk because the studio could have added in cursing and gore for the sake of cursing and gore. However\, the gritty style of the film and situations the characters found themselves in called for the intense action sequences delivered. Seeing Logan and young Laura (Dafne Keen) fight side-by-side was fantastic!\n\nWhile this movie had great moments\, the sum of its parts left me disappointed. There are a lot of predictable moments in this movie. I made a calculated guess about what the general plot would be before watching a single frame\, and I was right. The blatant foreshadowing of events to come felt as if the director didn't believe in the intelligence of his audience. There was also a big reveal about a character towards the end of the movie that could have opened up its own can of worms\, but they completely glossed over the fact in a rushed finale.\n\nIn the end\, Logan is entertaining. The action sequences are exciting\, and the protagonists are perfect in their roles. However\, a weak script and poor direction through most of the third act result in a half-hearted ending\, weakening the movie as a whole.

Logan is violent\, vulgar\, and disturbing\, this film will give your kids nightmares. Logan is supposedly the last time Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine\, it might also very well end the current X-Men film franchise\, that has produced nine feature films and brought in billions of dollars. That being said\, I expected an epic conclusion\, the likes of which Marvel had never done before\, and what I got was somewhat of a disappointment. It takes place in the future and yes\, Logan is older\, but he's still the Wolverine\, so I was expecting a fair bit of fighting and chases\, but it seems that was pretty much all this film has to offer. A deteriorating Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) claims that even though a new mutant hasn't been born in decades\, he is speaking to one that needs help\, and as it turns out he was right.

154221,Logan,2017-05-18,4,"More than anything\, Logan (2017) serves as a well-meaning denouement for Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart to conclude their fifteen-year+ run as the X-Men characters Wolverine and Professor X\, respectively. In doing so\, director James Mangold goes for a gritty\, thoughtful cinematic style that commands your attention while distracting the audience from the HUGE plotholes of the narrative. For example\, how and why is there a 'safe haven' for mutants if there hadn't been any new mutants born for 29 years? If such a place exists\, how it is remotely possible that the Alpha Males of 'Mutantness' don't know about it? Professor X and Wolverine wonder the same thing to dismiss the possibility but then\, both sacrifice a great deal to get Dafne Keen's Laura to said safe haven. Finally\, Mangold's over filling the frame with mutants (including a clone) undercuts the entire premise of the story itself\, i.e. there seem to be plenty of mutants around.

155186,Logan,2017-03-05,5,"My excitement for Logan was two fold. One\, I was excited to see them show Wolverine do some serious killing. In the past they had stretched the PG13 rating\, like in X2 or The Wolverine\, but it tended to be many of shots of him slicing at people or stabbing their chest. In this film we get head shots. Also\, the story of X-23 was one of the only ones I read in the comics. I feel attached to her and was excited to see how she was portrayed on film. Also\, there was a bit of a rush to think of characters I had known from previous movies dropping the F bomb. \n\nThe tone of the film is very much captured in that first trailer. Charles has dementia and his brain is deteriorating\, Logan is doing an odd job to make ends meet and Caliban has given up a life of locating mutants with Olivia Munn. The characters are all portrayed to their fullest\, even Caliban (who we saw portrayed by a different actor in AoA).The set up of the story is a beautiful mesh of Old Man Logan and X-23's origin. We all know Jackman and Stewart deliver\, they sell the shit out of the father/son dynamic\, but the bad guy played by Boyd Holbrook & Dafne Keen's Laura have also been cast perfectly. The action is as great as any other X-men film\, but one could argue better because it comes across more real. This is slightly due to the R-Rating\, but has alot more to do with the writing. \n\nThat being said\, while there is enjoyment to be gotten from the film\, there is no joy - especially in the final hour of the movie. You realize upon meeting this family\, shown in the trailers giving the trip a hot meal\, that they are going to be dispatched. They've just got to be. And its an emotional roller coaster ride. I'd say the moment they introduce X-24\, his character just gives you anxiety. You know that he is a near unstoppable force that Logan would be hard pressed to ever defeat.  All of the sad moments are followed by dismal moments. You are given a bit of hope\, but it is fleeting because you know soon\, insurmountable odds face our heroes. It is awesome to watch Logan grow out of what he has become due to this miniature female version of himself. The film is honestly a western about a gunslinger long past his era.

155792,Logan,2017-03-04,5,"Never before have I seen a \""superhero\"" movie that was as gutsy as Logan. The fact that this movie was made the way it has been presented\, is nothing short of amazing! In a time where movie studios seem to be more of a hindrance to the creative process than trying to encourage it\, it is commendable that Fox let Mangold make the movie he has delivered. This hardly feels like the standard superhero movie we are used to. This is refreshing when so many superhero movies are a paint by numbers affair. Logan stands out as more of a drama than a flashy superhero movie. The action scenes are executed superbly well but what makes them great is that there is an emotional driver to every one of them. This really caused me to invest in this movie and care about the characters and what happens to them. It is a human story that I found very easy to relate to. I find that we are going through a difficult time in the world where we are surrounded by stories of doom and gloom and hope is sometimes hard to find. I find that this movie captures that sentiment extremely well. Many may disagree with me but I felt hopeful leaving the cinema. Unfortunately I heard some negative comments when exiting the cinema and there was an annoying couple in front of me who talked through the movie. People have become accustomed to the glossy superhero action movies we are force fed these days. If you want a movie with true substance and depth\, then you should watch Logan. The violence was brutal but I felt it necessary to make this world feel real where violence has consequences and people don't just get magically knocked over the head unconscious by our heroes. It felt authentic and honest and I was not pulled out of the experience by shoddy CGI or distracting wire work. Overall I found this movie inspiring! I really hope that future superhero movies can take something from this movie. DC\, I'm looking at you mainly. It's called character development. I loved Hugh Jackman in the role of Wolverine! I feel like I grew up with him playing this character and at the end of the day\, this is a fitting tribute to him playing this character! Young Dafne Keen and slightly older Patrick Steward were amazing in this movie. The performances were really top notch from the entire cast! No movie is perfect and there are very minor gripes I have with this one but they're not even worth mentioning.

Whether in its approach\, techniques or themes\, it's not what you'd expect from this genre\, and specially for the X-Men franchise which\, for me\, is not a very successful one when it comes to quality. Though I consider that Days of Future Past is the best X-Men movie so far\, mainly for being able to balance a vast array of characters in a intricate plot\, this is a clear second place (Deadpool being third - watch it carefully and you'll know why) . Logan is gritty to its core\, its well scored and cast\, and the CGI blends seamlessly to the film. The action scenes aren't free of the over-cutting syndrome of superhero movies\, but still it's the best direction that the character has received. I really wasn't that keen on Wolverine before and now I understand it was the way he was being treated that caused me discomfort. And make no mistake\, the R rating is the main propeller of this shift in how the character is portrayed. It's fabulously satisfying to see violence in all its gore as when Logan rips the guts out of people\, we see those guts\, which makes a huge difference in a directorial point of view\, as the constraints to stage and cut around what's explicit are out of questions. And we do have to thank Deadpool for this\, as it opened the way for R-rated superhero movies (basically\, it took Ryan Reynolds to show that 9/11 happened and we're big boys now\, we can take a little blood). Also\, the script is as sharp as his claws\, which contributes to the tonal focus that is very indicative of Eastwood's westerns\, which is further pursued by the crisp cinematography and color pallet\, very reminiscent of Hell or High Water and many others that have come before. That ultimately adheres to the movie so intrinsically that it doesn't seem to fit in the superhero genre. Though\, it has a rushed ending and a minor lack of total payoff\, it's very bizarre to have such a good movie this early in the year and it's specially impactful to bring something new to a increasingly saturated genre. SPOILER (BUT NOT REALLY) \nI also thought it was very relevant that this is the first \""superhero\"" movie with such an emotional and mature theme. In the end\, it's no spoiler to say that this film is about ending. Ending a cycle\, ending a character's life\, while still maintaining hope as driving force. Hope is what gets the movie from A to B\, even if B is where you say goodbye. More than an actor parting from a character that he has inhabited\, this movie is a film elegy.

It leaves a residue. It causes you to stare at that screen as the credits roll by\, at that road as you drive home and think. You knew going in that there were\, of course\, two options with Wolverine he was either going to die or walk off into that glorious sunset\, with Laura\, never to be seen again. I of course was hoping for the latter. But it was not to be. The course of the entire movie was Logan coming to grips with\, in his mind\, a pointless reality and waiting for that perfect time to put an adamantium bullet in his head through tissue that couldn't regenerate (sorry guys I disagree with the comics on this one\, been in the medical field too long to think brain cells can regenerate). Anyways\, his life hits a major bump when he comes across this girl\, who hardly says a word. She is seeing many things for the first time and is expecting Logan to be a person that she has only read about in comics. The meat of the movie involves a constant struggle to escape the trackers. But it also centers around the mans ability to take someone into his life again and push away that fear that that person would simply be added to the list of those killed around him. That final seen where he lay dying and says \""Laura\"" and she responds \""daddy\"" just grabs your heart and squeezes... and squeezes for the next 15 minutes. You are saddened not only because of his death but because of the fact that she will grow up without a father; a father that just realized how important she was to him...

Manigold also makes great use of the R rating\, finally showing Wolverine in full berserker mode  while touching on more adult themes such as death & family\, along with playing against expectations (don't expect everyone to make it to the end).

While I feel Batman and Spider-man have had at least one great film each Wolverine never has - his solo films have sucked. So it was with great relief that Jackman's last Wolverine film is the character's best. Not just in film but probably in all media versions from the late 90s. There are some silly elements throughout the film\, especially the finale\,but I can forgive them because they get Wolverine right. As an added bonus we also get one of Patrick Stewart's finest performances as the tragic Xavier who has seen his dream die. That's right the film's setting is grim and overall is more like a western version of \""the road\""  than any superhero film we've seen so far.\nThe R rating allows us to see Wolverine cut loose but it's vicious and seems painful - especially the damage Logan sustains throughout. Jackman does a great job of portraying a person past their prime with nothing to show for it. I was hesitant about Mangold getting another chance at a wolverine film but it's clear studio interference was more at play than his lack of skill and he's a director who I now have more faith in. With Deadpool and Logan (and the disaster that was X-men:apocalypse) hopefully Fox will embrace a more creative approach to the franchise and think about how best to utilise the characters they have.

It is unlike any other X-Men film\, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.\n\nWhen I saw the first trailer drop\, headlined by Johnny Cash's \""Hurt\""\, I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre\, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come.\n\nThe introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen\, and though doesn't say much\, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better\, especially seen in certain scenes.\n\nLastly\, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen\, it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role\, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman.\n\nOverall\, Mangold and the cast\, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film\, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe.",True,0.8295892477035522,0.79975426197052,0.7870557904243469,0.8242356777191162,0.8000895380973816,0.809561550617218,0.6861119270324707,0.8248606324195862,0.7904627323150635

This movie is about love and what is most important in one's life. This is a story about internal struggle. About doing what is right versus what you want. It is about being loved and returning that love to someone else. And yet\, it is a superhero movie. \n\nHugh Jackman gives us his best performance as Wolverine ever. Patrick Stewart plays a Professor Xavier that we never wanted to see but have too. Dafne Keen helps bring out the best in both of the previously mentioned. \n\nIf you have ever read the Old Man Logan Comic Arch you will not be disappointed in this adaptation of it. For obvious reasons this story could not be translated directly due to character rights however the core is most definitely still there. The struggle to provide and to do what has to be done is prominent in this film. We finally see Logan's arc that started nearly two decades ago come full circle while still being unpredictable and exciting. \n\nIf you are going into this movie thinking it is going to be a light hearted easy watch\, you might want to stop. This movie makes me want to go to my family and tell them I love them. In a gory and dark way\, this story reminds us that nothing is more important than the friends and family around us everyday.\n\nI give this movie a REDONKULUS Rating.

To realize that the once dignified and all-powerful Prof. X was also susceptible to time and disease hit dead center in the heart for me as I'm in the middle of caring for my own elderly parents right now. I related to Logan every time he had to put his foot down and be stern despite Charles' suffering. Charles speaking and Logan ignoring/denying is so very much my experience too. \n\nBut the moment that got me pretty hard was watching Charles requiring Logan's help in the simple request\, \""Logan\, Logan! ...

Logan\, directed by James Mangold (who previously directed Walk the Line and the better Wolverine movie\, The Wolverine rather than X-men Origins\, which was a big critical flop\, among others) is a return to the quality action and story we have come to know and love in our X-men films.\n\nSNIKT. SNIKT\, oh\, and more SNIKT.\n\nThat's the sound that his claws make.  Seriously\, look at the comics (which I haven't read myself...)  And this time around there's multiple sets of claws.  X-23 or Laura (Dafne Keen)-a child mutant- has the claws of the Wolverine\, something Logan refuses to believe until he sees her in action.  This is as much her origin story as it is a farewell to the Wolverine that we know.\n\nThis is a farewell film for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine after a long 17 years and now TECHNICALLY 9 movies (though in First Class\, he just had a cameo role).  And\, it is a wonderfully done farewell film that leaves the audience adequately satisfied with his ending.\n\nDon't let some of the professional reviews fool you.

177563,Logan,2017-03-12,5,"The ninth and apparently final film to star Hugh Jackman in the lead role has a deeply ingrained sadness to it and not just from a plot standpoint but it genuinely feels like the end of an era since I have been with the two lead characters over the course of several films for nearly two decades. Adding to that the first X-Men film was the first superhero film I genuinely loved and got me into the genre so not only were there high expectations for this but I was also somewhat ambivalent about whether I should see this due to knowing this would end the series in some ways but I am glad I did take the time to watch this. Firstly Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are incredible\, easily the best they have been in this long running series and they take what they are given (which is a solid plot and script) into deeply emotional and fierce roles which are aged but not lessened. The supporting cast is also really good with Dafne Keen as Laura being the best of the bunch and managing to hold her own against veteran actors. The action is incredible with its grounded but utterly violent fight scenes which are done in a more serious and fierce approach compared to the likes of Deadpool and the way the violence is dealt with is far better with this film than that and I know they are tonally different but it works far better for me. It also looks great with some beautiful cinematography and well edited action\, the score isn't bombastic being even somewhat mournful and even though the ending is sad it is also hopeful and opens the door to great potential for the series to be carried forward by a new generation.",True,0.8286939263343811,0.7752541303634644,0.7833245396614075,0.8167675137519836,0.4714004099369049,0.7603025436401367,0.7265483736991882,0.7966331839561462,0.7581757307052612

Logan has gone back to his old habits of drugs and booze and Professor X seems to be in the early stage of dementia. There is a new generation of mutants\, but they are constructed for the military and not springing up on their own. There lies the plot because the military wants these escaped X kids back and one of them seems to be a sort of clone of Logan. While there is mayhem aplenty here\, the major issue is Logan trying to come grips with his own role in this. Hugh Jackman is still ripped\, if a bit worn down and Dafne Keen as his young offspring is just terrific. No spoilers here but there is no hidden scene in the credits so this might be the last X Men movie or the start of a new franchise.

Patrick Stewart is fantastic as an ailing\, unwell Professor X (Who suffers from dementia and Alzheimers). Hugh Jackman puts on his best performance yet as Wolverine/Logan.

I give it an 8 of 10 rating only because there is no way it can be a 10 of 10 or even a 9 of 10\, and I think I will be correct in that assessment once I see it without all the f-words and gore.  The performances of Jackman and Stewart\, along with the solid story and a good and steady pace\, provide a solid ending with finality and closure for not only the X-Men franchise but the ‘superhero' genre as a whole(whether Marvel and D.C. will admit or not.)

179553,Logan,2016-12-18,5,"The whole X-Men universe has been a huge part of not just my childhood\, but my whole life up to this point. I've loved almost every film\, fan of the comics\, and loved every minute of X-Men: The Animated Series. Hugh Jackman is widely-known for his role as Logan aka Wolverine\, and he has given it his all in every appearance. I was very iffy with the first Wolverine standalone film\, and The Wolverine was pretty solid\, but it was this movie I was most excited for. Deadpool laid the foundation for R-rated superhero movies\, and Logan was the film ready to pick it up and run with it. After watching the film\, it's safe to say that Logan is one of the best superhero films of all time. This film\, along with Deadpool\, proves that you don't need to have a massive budget and crazy special effects to deliver a great superhero movie. Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart give it their all in their last performances as Logan and Charles. Dafne Keen was also very entertaining\, and I see a bright future for her in this franchise. The villains were solid\, especially Boyd Holbrook's character\, and this journey was fast-paced and brilliantly bloody. If Disney had the X-Men franchise we would've never gotten this film\, so sometimes it's best for Disney to not have every Marvel character in their possession. This was the Wolverine movie we were all waiting for\, and I am thankful for Hugh Jackman's last performance as Logan.",True,0.7704359889030457,0.754999577999115,0.7200086712837219,0.7651548981666565,0.7159550189971924,0.7446368932723999,0.6709028482437134,0.7249537706375122,0.6822963953018188
179556,Logan,2017-06-02,5,"The Wolverine character has been a part of cinema history for the last 17 years and has given fans some highs and some very bad lows\, e.g. \""Wolverine: X-Men Origins.\"" But with Hugh Jackman announcing that \""Logan\"" would be his wave goodbye\, it was only fitting to really send the character away in the right way. So when it was announced that Fox would release an R-rated Wolverine film\, it was shocking\, and at the same time\, refreshing because many have really yet to see the character live up to the comic book persona. The release of Logan had many fans excited and worried because could it be a half-assed send-off or the right send off for a character that will live on for ages as a beloved character.\n\nPositives\nThe film gives you exactly what you want... what you always wanted... Wolverine. The character has always been \""censored\"" due to PG-13 ratings but it is very telling how the blood and anger displayed on the screen give you a sense of freedom. But violence aside\, the film at its core is very emotional. It deals with subject matters\, very real ones\, that everyone deals with\, e.g. the caring of an ailing father or the struggle to accept one's own mortality. The emotion displayed on film elevates it to the bar of \""The Dark Knight\"" status and really makes all other comic book films childish in comparison.\nA very good\, and again refreshing\, aspect of \""Logan\"" is that it is very much a \""standalone\"" film. That means that this movie does not rely on what happened in \""X-Men: Days of Future Past\"" or \""X-Men: Apocalypse\""\, this movie is a single story with the purpose of telling a single tale. The movie benefits from this because it gives every single character a reason to exist in this story and you don't have to worry about why character A is this if he was in movie C and did act E. This movie goes back to an old standard of storytelling.\n\nNegatives\n\""Logan\"" really has little to no flaws in that you can see there was a lot of thought and care put into the story. The fact of being R-rated and not linked to a \""universe\"" frees the movie up and lets it breathe. This may set a trend or be part of the Deadpool trend but we will have to see if studios decide to take a risk like this again.\n\nOverall\n\""Logan\"" is a masterpiece in the comic book genre. It is now cemented in history as one of those films that set the bar for comic book and films in general. The story\, the characters\, the emotions all displayed on film are enough to make this a movie you stop and watch whenever it comes on tv.

First of all\, this is\, supposedly\, Hugh Jackman's last film portraying Wolverine. If so\, I say that this is the best way to go out. His acting is incredible and this is one of his best performance yet in any film. Sir. Patrick Stewart delivers once again as Professor Xavier with a nuanced performance. Dafne Keen was a pleasant surprise and could be the best child actor I have ever seen. Her ability to portray strong emotions and her physicality in the action scenes were inspiring.

183101,Logan,2017-03-04,4,"This is the Wolverine movie fans have been waiting for for years\, and it surely pays off.\n\nHugh Jackman has played the character of Wolverine since the first installment of Fox's X-Men franchise. Playing the same character for 17 years over the course of 9 nine films is an incredible feat. Although the X-Men films have had ups (X-Men\, X2\, First Class\, Days of Future Past)\, they've also had their downs (X-Men: The Last Stand\, X-Men Origins). The one thing that has been constant throughout the series though is Jackman's portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. It has always been a highlight of the series\, and this film surely shows how bright that highlight is.\n\nThe Positives: The thing that most stands out about this film is definitely the performances by Jackman\, Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Dafne Keen (Laura). Jackman gives his best performance (and sadly it will be his last\, at least that is what Jackman has said) as the titular character. Jackman makes you feel for Logan more than you have ever felt for the character. The amount of loss\, violence and heartbreak the character has felt over the course of films all shows in Jackman's performance in this film. It is tremendous. Stewart does a phenomenal job as Professor X in this film as well. It's hard to compare his performance in this film to his other performances in the series because he plays the character very differently this time. Professor X is suffering from old age and a mental illness that causes him to be the frailest he has ever been. Dafne Keen's performance as Laura definitely stuck out too. I hope to see her in future installments of the series! Another positive I have about the film was direction that James Mangold took this film. A lot of critics are saying that \""this definitely does not feel like a comic book movie.\"" I have to agree with that. In a time where CGI explosions and over-bloated fight scenes are the trend\, Logan strays away from that. Although there is action in the film (damn violent action mind you\, that R rating was well deserved)\, it isn't the focus of the film. The storytelling of these characters we've grown to love over the years (Logan and Professor X)\, as well as the new addition of Laura are the main focus of the film - which I love!\n\nThe Negatives: I don't have too many negatives with this film. One gripe I do have\, which is very small\, is about a character that is introduced in the middle of the film (Not Spoiling). I felt as if the scenes with this character felt way more \""comic book-y\"" than everyone else did in this film. It just didn't fit with the tone of the rest of the film. I wish it did\, but oh well. It did not greatly affect the viewing of the movie for me.\n\nThe Verdict: Days of Future Past was my favorite X-Men movie before going into this film\, but now I may have a new favorite. Not only is this my favorite X-Men film\, but this might be my favorite Marvel film. The movie went in directions that no other Marvel film has done before in terms of violence and story telling.

183802,Logan,2017-03-04,4,"This movie earns a solid 4 Icee rating (out of 5).  First off\, I must confess I went into this movie with the full intent to hate it.  I haven't liked an X-Men movie since X2. X3 was stupid\, and the First Class movies have been so inconsistent with the rest of the franchise\, it was just hogwash.  Don't tell me they're in a \""different universe\"" than the originals either.  That shipped sailed when they used the characters from the originals to supplement the new.  They just have been bad.  Also\, incredibly inconsistent. First\, Charles is dead\, and the BAM.. he's alive in a subsequent movie with no explanation as to how he returned.  \n\nSo\, with all that said\, this movie was good.  Really good.  Now I must start off by saying that this movie is not a kids superhero movie.  It more than earns its R-rating for the graphic violence.  The death toll in this movie is pretty large\, and most of them die in a way that isn't pleasant\, to say the least.\n\nAlso\, this is the type of movie you actually have to pay attention to when they are talking\, because that is how they establish the past.  That's how you find out it is 2029.  That's how you find out what happened to mutants. That's how you learn (somewhat) about the other X-Men.  That's how you learn how a man that has been alive for centuries is now aging.\n\nThis movie has an excellent mix of storytelling and violent action. The moves of the little girl are awesome. She's got skilz.\n\nThis is not your stereo-typical X-Men movie\, by any means\, so you need to accept that and go in with an open mind. I would describe it as more of a dystopian action film\, where the future is dark\, and the heroes have to deal with it.\n\nAlthough there are no scenes after the film\, you don't want to be late because there is a trailer at the beginning of the film.

186248,Logan,2017-03-04,5,"This movie was a revolutionary masterpiece. Just as Deadpool revolutionized Comic Book movies in terms of raucous humor\, Logan changes the game with this dark\, brooding tale that served as Hugh Jackman's swan song as the most famous X-Man Wolverine. It is loosely based (and I mean loosely) on a story called \""Old Man Logan\"" and while it did not match the grandiose story from the comic books\, it keeps the spirit of the story.\n\nThe movie takes place in the not-so-distant future of the post Days of Future Past timeline and an aging Logan who is losing his mutant powers is left taking care of a rapidly mentally deteriorating Professor X. The future is grim as mutants are fading away. Logan is then introduced to someone who reminds him of himself and the adventure begins.\nThe violence is extremely graphic but in this instance\, it does not distract from the very tight storyline. \n\nWhere other X-Men stories really go for the big action\, glitz and excitement (last year's X-Men Apocalypse went a tad overboard with this idea). . This is a different Logan\, he is not the brash character from other films. Other movies made Logan the Weapon\, but the tables are turned on the X-Men we know and love. The strongest assets of Logan and Professor X are now weaknesses. Logan's body is failing and Xavier's mind is slowly faltering. Yet\, the movie gives us the opportunity to see each of them with flashes of who they were and how powerful they truly were. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman were allowed to act in this one and their chops were fully on display. Dafne Keen plays Laura\, from the comic books known as X-23. \n\nWith so much focus on Marvel Studios versus DC\, Fox has another home run on its hands with this X-Men Universe feature. Fox is going places where DC refuses. They are pushing the envelope and giving us great quality stories.

188421,Logan,2017-03-11,5,"This was the last time we'll see Hugh Jackman & Patrick Stewart in their roles of Wolverine and Professor X. Thus is fitting that their last roles should be in one of the finest X-Men movie ever made. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is finally getting old\, being alive for a 200+ years and his powers are slowly failing him. He takes care of Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who also is in extreme old age and failing to control his psychic powers. Their lives are interrupted by the arrival of a mysterious girl Laura (the incredible Daphne Keen) who happens to have the same powers as Logan and group of bad men chasing her...\nFrom the start\, we see that this is something different: it's all very gritty\, grim and dark and in all of it's R-Rated glory we finally see the Wolverine doing some really badass R-Rated stuff...and also curse in every other line of dialogue. Hugh Jackman is and always will be Wolverine\, this was his role and in his final movie as the said hero\, he does some seriously great acting and action-acting but it was the young girl\, who shines just as bright\, that makes his portrayal so damn good. Daphne Keen was perfect as X-23\, the mutant girl with the same powers as Wolverine. She kicks ass like there is no tomorrow and when it's time to act\, she too was incredible. She's got a bright future ahead. Patrick Stewart was also great\, in his very different portrayl of Professor X\, from what we have used to see in previous movies. Old(er)\, forgetful and frail\, he also has some great scenes and he forms a funny duo with Hugh Jackman as the odd couple\, the last mutants still standing.\nOtherwise the other charecters are quite thin and the villains are there for just cannon fodder but since it's clearly made for the main trio\, you can easily forget and forgive that fact.\nThe action was finally on level it should have been from the start: limbs are lost\, heads are sliced and so much blood. It's finally done right and I'm not some gore-blood fanatic but when your main character has three blades coming out of his hands\, things should get messy and bloody and a bit gory. The whole thing is done with pure professionalism too\, so no worries there. The best Wolverine action experience is finally here and it's on the finale\, quite fitting.\nSo in final words\, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart it is sad to see you go but what joy it has been to watch you bring these charecters to life in the big screen and to end in such high note as \""Logan\""\, proves that you truly are masters of your craft.",True,0.11992571502923965,0.13872374594211578,0.1134299486875534,0.12579235434532166,0.1155417263507843,0.12006571143865585,0.1144968792796135,0.11758881062269211,0.1266479641199112
188966,Logan,2017-03-13,5,"Time to finally review Logan.\nThe movie Logan basically takes place in the future where the mutants are almost extinct and the stories of the X-men are remembered in comic books. What is good about this movie is that it can take place later in the new days of future past timeline\, while acting as its own movie in a separate universe. One can by the beginning of the movie that something is wrong when Logan is much more fatigue and is not healing the way he use to. He is struggling to get medicine for Charles Xavier\, while staying secret.\nThis is Hugh Jackman's best performance as the character\, because we are able to explore the wolverine persona inside of him that is still hanging\, which allows us to understand the long struggle of Logan's own mortality. As his healing factor fades\, he begins to seem more human and open up his soul to happiness and peace. Patrick Stewart was once again amazing and him and Jackman's chemistry is one point. Some of his lines were hit or miss due to some of the circumstances\, but at times it was believable. Dafne Keen was great as Laura/X23 and her character benefited more by being Logan's daughter rather then clone.\nOne thing the X-men movies usually tackles in their movies is prejudice\, but this time the movie seems to do so with the mutants by showing the struggles of immigrants. This movie symbolizes how immigrants struggle so much to get to a place of peace and have to deal with much conflict to reach that peace. This allows the movie to have Logan represent the people in our society who are willing to put their needs aside in order to help those reach peace that the hero once had; wanting them to experience the happiness that they once or never felt.\nThe action in this movie was great and I thought the R-rating allowed for more of the savage Wolverine and X23 to show their stuff\, which leads into some of the problems I had with this movie. Some of the shaky cam and camera angles made it hard to focus in on the action that would take place. Sometimes when Wolverine and X23 would attack someone\, the moment would look blurry at times and caused me to be taken out of the film for a moment and loose my excitement from watching the action on screen. The second act of the movie could have had more emotion and explored the family dynamic between Charles\, Logan\, and Laura more\, rather slowing the movie down giving the audience a false sense of peace.\nOverall\, I thought Logan was an excellent superhero movie that requires one to read in between the lines rather then ones traditional superhero film that is more straightforward. Great character depth that will put the audience on an emotional roller coaster.

194552,Logan,2016-10-22,5,"Well\, it took nearly 10 years. But finally\, a film surpassed The Dark Knight as my favorite comic book movie. \n Similar to The Dark Knight\, Logan aims to be a much more mature comic book movie. Not just because of how graphic it's violence is (though yeah\, this movie is definitely a hard R rated movie)\, or how strong the language is (Wolverine's always had a bit of a potty mouth. But he\, along with Xavier drop F-bombs constantly). Tough both of these aspects do add to the tone and feel of the film\, that it's not for kids\, that it's gritty and violent\, and that Wolverine and Professor X are now both bitter old men after everything they've been through. Wolverine in particular feels he has nothing left to live for other then taking care of Xavier. \n But the film focuses a lot on character\, a lot of people are comparing this movie to a western\, and I certainly see it. Wolverine in this movie is very much the bitter old hero\, way past his prime\, who's lost his way\, and\, albeit reluctantly\, on one last ride. \n Which wouldn't be near as compelling without the performances of Hugh Jackman\, Sir Patrick Stewart\,and new comer Dafne Keen. I've said a couple of times\, but it's the truth. Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar nomination for this film. \n Also a bit of a spoiler here. So don't read if you haven't seen it. But Wolverine's evil clone\, X-24. Why I think he works. More then just the typical evil clone/inner demon angle. But in his fights with X-24\, Wolverine is fighting his own mortality. He's past his prime\, he doesn't heal as well as he use to\, he's slowly dying (As a result of his old age\, Wolverine's healing factor is starting to decline\, and as a result\, the adamantium inside of his body is causing him to feel the effects of metal poisoning\, as a result\, Wolverine is slowly dying) Fighting someone\, who is literally himself at his peek\, in his current condition. I cannot think of a more fitting way\, for a man to struggle with the fact he's slowly dying. \n It's also pretty family focused. Wolverine's only reason for living at this point\, it to take care of Xavier\, who's something of a father figure to him (Even though Wolverine actually is more then twice Xavier's age. Least actual age\, not mentally or physically)\, and throughout the film\, meeting his own daughter.",True,0.8145866990089417,0.805611789226532,0.7943359613418579,0.8139142990112305,0.7985530495643616,0.8094527721405029,0.810566782951355,0.8152387142181396,0.820951521396637

The movie starts off with a bang and even perhaps ends off with events from Days of Future Past\, showing that changing the past will not change the major impacts in the future. The most satisfying thing is that since it is Rated R\, there were many brutal and bloody scenes that finally highlight the violent character of the Wolverine and what he is capable of. The R rating finally opened up to the character to a more free action scenes that should have been done back in the Origins. Though it took 17 damn years for that to happen\, the wait was worth while for a near perfect portrayal of the Wolverine. \n\nJackman definitely made it worthwhile on his efforts to make it the best of his last\, having to show his emotional acting to the hardcore stunts that he had to perform. You can just tell from his face that this is the last and that he will do everything he can to make every single scene count. Also\, Jackman has to show a different side of the Wolverine than we have seen from previous X-Men films\, being more pessimistic and darker. Lets also consider the character development may have highlighted his acting. I also enjoyed the new actress Dafne\, who truly showed a very emotional acting. Patrick Stewart was also great in his role as Charles Xavier\, which sadly also happens to be his last time playing. Also\, the chemistry between Stewart and Jackman was another big highlight\, making it the peeking point of emotions and really connecting to this long lasting friendship. \n\nThe movie does have some flaws but not enough to make the movie any less emotional and great. There was some poor development on the villain as that is the usual norm for Marvel movies. However\, I didn't consider it as a problem\, only because I felt it was appropriate to keep the attention on Wolverine and his relationship with X-23. Also\, there were some scenes that contain a bit too much dialogue which may have dragged a bit. Again\, not too much to totally hurt the movie.\n\nYou can just tell from the start that this will be a special movie since it is the end for many people. They put every effort to screen some of the best and brutal action scenes and fights. Lets also say that there is a special pre-scene that you will get to see that hypes the movie. This is definitely the most emotional X-Men movie of all those released. It is movie that people can easily relate in terms of the struggle that each and every character had to experience. Not to mention\, there were quite some content that just fits with recent issues today. It is sad to see that this will be the end for both Jackman and Stewart\, but this swan song will truly be a classic in the future and will be remembered.

I remember I was 11 years old when I logged in to AOL and in their news section they had pictures of the cast for the first movie\, no one I had ever heard of (except Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan) but I was still excited beyond belief. I begged my mom to take me to see it so she drove myself and two friends from elementary school to the Hoyt cinema in Hazleton and we sat front row because it was sold out. From start to finish I was in awe\, I was fresh off my seeing-phantom-menace-11-times-in-theatres phase and I hadn't seen a decent movie in months.

Logan is a powerhouse of a film\, the film takes place in 2029 and is about how mutants are pretty much instinct\, and how Logan is practically a washed up alcoholic who picks up little cash as a limo driver\, and he meets this girl who is in dire need of his help. Hugh Jackman absolutely blew me away in this film he has honestly never played Wolverine this perfectly before\, I don't even know what to do anymore knowing that he won't be playing the part anymore. Patrick Stewart also does a great job in this film as Charles Xavier. And finally Dafne Keen who played Laura not only great for the part she was also an absolute bad ass\, she has a very bright future a head of her. Though Logan is an outstanding film it is definitely not for everyone the film is extremely violent\, very dark\, and it is not necessarily the happiest marvel movie\, however you may not even care to be honest because as you watch the film odds are you will just want to continue watching till the very end.

96842,Logan,2017-03-03,5,"17 years after X-Men came out in theaters and sparked the modern superhero film genre comes Hugh Jackman's final outing as the character that truly defined his career\, like Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry or Heath Ledger's Joker: The Wolverine. And once again\, Fox has made a superhero film that - like Deadpool - shows different directions that superhero films could go in. \n\nLogan is a brutal movie in two ways: Despite its humor\, Logan is a films that beats you down. The Wolverine has always been the reluctant superhero\, a do-gooder who would rather be left alone than be a part of the world because bad luck tends to follow him. He has earned his brooding status because he's lost so much. This film is no different in that director James Mangold created a dystopian but extremely realistic future. As the film progresses\, you learn little by little how this world came to be\, and it is depressing and fascinating. This film is part Western\, part Children of Men\, and part redemption.\n\nIt's also brutal in violence. You would think that a film where the main character has three blades on each hand would be a bit bloody\, but that's rarely happened...until now. This is easily the Wolverine we were meant to see for so many years\, a realistic character where people die at his hand\, and he swears and drinks. But there are more reasons this is a rated R film\, and they are to be seen.\n\nHugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are amazing\, as is newcomer Dafne Keen\, whose performance is reminiscent of Chloe Grace Moritz's introduction in Kick-Ass. As much as I'd love to see more of them\, this is a truly fitting and wonderful conclusion. It's a great superhero film - probably the best dark superhero film since The Dark Knight\, a great Western\, an intimate story of family and coming of age\, and a great movie overall.

Back together for Logan\, Mangold has not only kept his distinct strengths of tone and combat\, but has ramped up the quality & gravitas rarely seen in a blockbuster. In one of the most brutally and beautifully made superhero films of all-time\, Logan gives audiences an experience full of gasps\, laughs\, and thrills...& buckets of blood.\nTaking place in the near-future\, we find our invincible anti-hero trying to live a quiet life\, driving a limo\, and taking care of his dangerously senile father-figure Xavier; yet his world is far from boring\, especially when a girl with familiar powers appears. The emotional anchor here is the Logan / Charles relationship; watching them deal with weakening bones\, a changing world and oncoming dementia is powerfully relatable. However\, the action is far from dormant.  Keen is a fantastic mutant newcomer\, grunting and fighting in ways that Logan himself doesn't have the virility for anymore. Instead\, he lumbers through his fights with vicious intensity and careless selflessness. \nAnd when I say \""vicious\""\, I mean \""vicious\""; this is NOT your kids X-Men. The R-rated door Deadpool knocked down has allowed Logan to violently dance on the other side. If you've ever felt like Wolverine's claws and fury felt neutered in a PG-13 world\, fear no more. However\, the violence is to a purpose; we're shown the difficult effects in honest and effective ways\, especially in the jarring use of children.

Like DEADPOOL\, it uses it's R wisely- here to intensify the violence and brutality and serious atmosphere director James Mangold and star Hugh Jackman wanted to finally deliver. Yes\, Wolverine never dons the famous yellow and black during this\, but we see him more animalistic than even his brief cameo in the last X-MEN film\, and yet also more vunerable than almost ever before too. Considering all the different timelines in play in the X-Universe\, seeing this shattered yet defiant to the end Logan makes sense. Especially given the script's framing of what may have happened to the X-MEN\, which allows Patrick Stewart to turn in a moving performance as Xavier. Don't overlook Caliban either! I could've done without the literal facing of his own demons aspect\, and would've liked to have seen more conflict with X 23 and even bring back Sabretooth\, but those are my preferences\, and the film's choices didn't betray series legacy while taking Logan in a different direction again.

No holding back\, no tip-toeing around violence. Wolverine absolutely benefitted from the R-rating\, and because of it\, because of the brutality\, made it more real. (Mucho gracias to Deadpool!)\n\nOne of the reasons why LOGAN worked was cuz it didn't involve any \""save-the-world\"" scenario. It kept it localized\, intimate\, and grounded. If Wolverine had to save the world then it'd be kinda predictable\, in that\, you'd know the world would totally be saved with or without sacrifice. But in LOGAN\, the danger is more real and more imminent\, you never knew who was gonna die\, how\, when\, etc. And when something bad did happen\, they did it emotionally. LOGAN was more of an action/drama than a superhero movie\, and it worked so well.\n\nThe top three cast all nailed it! Hugh Jackman will be missed\, if LOGAN was his last Wolverine movie\, he went out with a frickin bang; Sir Patrick Stewart playing a deteriorating Professor X... jeebus\, anyone with an older family member suffering from dementia/Alzheimers/ALS/etc\, would be holding back tears; newcomer Dafne Keen\, holy shit\, she was frickin good.

Dafne Keen\, who plays the little girl\, is also wonderful in the part\, though I question the choice of her casting just because she looks so eerily similar to Evan Peters\, who plays Quicksilver in the previous two X-installments.

Wolverine films to date\, although enjoyable on the whole\, have lacked the sheer brutality required to do adequate justice to the story of Logan\, and have left many fans feeling somewhat flat - but no less enamoured with Jackman's embodiment of the character.\n\nIn undertaking an adaptation of the \""Old Man Logan\"" storyline from the comics\, Mangold faced a huge task to faithfully portray this savage narrative\, but handled it with ridiculous aplomb\, creating a defining film to send off the character with a stunning crescendo. In Dafnee Keen\, a new star was born amidst the slashed bodies and dismembered limbs. She truly rose above the chaos to all but steal the show from Jackman. Patrick Stewart bid farewell to his beloved Charles Xavier in another remarkable performance. The acting was quite simply\, sublime\, the pacing was perfection\, the canon was honoured\, and the production was fitting. What more is there to say? Make no mistake about it\, this film deserves to be ranked amongst all films\, not just the sub-genre of comic book adaptations. Ranked highly indeed. 4/5 (yes\, it was THAT good)",True,0.7300572991371155,0.7152844667434692,0.7004666924476624,0.7298539876937866,0.6428292393684387,0.7013722062110901,0.6809959411621094,0.6987667679786682,0.7045629620552063
100776,Logan,2019-06-06,5,"A heavy and amazing sendoff to the character of Wolverine from the Fox X-Men universe. Absolutely unreal film\, honestly the best movie in the X-Men movie universe.

It’s so somber and just plain out depressing at points and so badass in others and overall it’s just a complete emotional ride!

101046,Logan,2017-03-04,5,"A little warning. This is one of the darkest \""superhero\"" comic book movies out there\, not just in content but in the story.\n\nSo the movie picks up a while after Days of Future Past. Logan is now a limo driver making ends meet to take care of the senile Professor X\, who is now dangerously senile. When a young girl with her own adamantium claws comes into his life\, Logan is forced to go on the run from the henchmen of a corporation creating mutants.\n\nHugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart know this is the last time they are playing these characters\, and they delivered a great performance. Both do inspire melancholy in me\, seeing what happened over the years. \n\nThe story is great. There's no epic final battle in a city. This is all grounded in dirty realism and a lot of blood\, sweat\, and tears.\n\nI strongly recommend Logan for a change of superhero pace. As I said\, this is a very dark film\, and very bloody.

101471,Logan,2017-06-02,4,"A lot of the action is fun to watch\, and the blood and gore makes it hard to believe there were ever films about Wolverine with less than R ratings. But\, where \""Logan\"" really shines is in its slower and more personal scenes between the three leads. The relationships here are great and it's refreshing to see a superhero film that lets characters exist outside of the monotone \""time to save the world\"" schtick. I do\, however\, wish the villain(s) either had less screen time or more imaginative traits. None of them stood out and the main one was basically just Boyd Holbrook doing an impression of Calvin Candie from \""Django Unchained.\"" And\, as I've said before\, I'm not a fan of the constant cutting found in almost all modern action movies\, including this one. It wasn't as bad here as it was in something like \""Age of Ultron\,\"" but I think it would've been beneficial to let the more emotional scenes play slower. Even with the flaws I've mentioned\, I'm glad this was the film to end Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's runs as Wolverine and Professor X. It works well as a standalone movie\, but it's also nice to have a worthy conclusion to a series that started when I was a little kid.",True,0.4032728672027588,0.33134791254997253,0.2889065146446228,0.32869207859039307,0.25236785411834717,0.23473702371120453,0.21595817804336548,0.3037186563014984,0.33836331963539124
