It had its own personality and taste but was brought down by its slow-paced\, clunky and repetitive gameplay. This prequel is no different.Rockstar obviously put a lot of effort into creating an immersive and visually stunning setting. All locations are beautifully crafted\, incredibly rich in detail\, and full of things to do and places to explore. Like in most open-world games\, the map is enormous just for the sake of it\, with most events concentrated in the rather small cities and camps\, but I guess that's how it really was back then. While graphics are impressive for a game of such scale\, I wish they could work a bit more on at least the main characters' models. Facial animations and skin textures are pretty good\, but hair mostly looks like something from a late seventh-generation game.The story is nothing new but delivers: it's backed up by a lot of memorable\, all-round characters\, and writing\, acting\, and direction are top-notch for a videogame. It was great to meet the rest of Dutch’s gang and see their development throughout the 40+ hours of the campaign. The connection with the events of the original game is well thought\, and Arthur is a surprisingly likable main character. It takes quite a considerable amount of gameplay to get to properly remember everyone\, get attached to them and finally get sucked in\, but it will pay off in the end.The gameplay is incredibly outdated: controls are clumsy\, unresponsive\, and convoluted. Combat and shooting suffer the most as everything is as flat and clunky as it was in the first game over eight years ago.Missions are repetitive\, monotonous\, and rarely rewarding. They can all be summed up as endless horse rides\, shoot-outs\, and fetching/moving objects with not much interaction. The game also decides to reset or change your inventory depending on the mission\, leaving no room for strategy in selecting good equipment. The rest is just an endless list of way too many unnecessary and tedious chores to remember. Shaving\, trimming\, hunting for food\, cooking\, eating\, cleaning weapons\, wearing the right clothing\, looting\, collecting money\, taking care of your horses\, etc. Most of these tasks surely add realism but are not that much fun to play. The game also gives you the opportunity to donate part of your rewards and loots to the gang to update the camp\, which I liked\, but it's mostly minor graphic additions and some provisions which you can easily find in the game anyway.Overall\, I really enjoyed the story\, setting and characters\, but the monotonous and outdated gameplay needs a lot of improvement. It would still recommend this game if you like open-world experiences but this is far from being the masterpiece professional reviewers are talking about… Expand",True,,,,,,

Even though I do have some problems with the game that I will address in this review\, I still think it's a great game and everyone should try it out.To start off\, the game is absolutely beautiful\, for the entirety of the time I played it which is about 50 hours of main missions plus the open world experience\, I never got tired of the visuals. Sunsets and mountains in the distance have never looked so fantastic. The soundtrack is also amazing and very immersive\, making all those long distance rides on your horse very enjoyable.Of course since it's a game by Rockstar Games and the sequel to RDR it has an open world. Because of better graphics I consider this to be their best open world yet. Which is an achievement considering how good GTA V's open world was. But even though the world is very beautiful and detailed RDR2 finds it self with the same problems as some of Rockstar's recent games which is they can't decide weather they want a complete open world experience or a cinematic experience. RDR2 feels stuck between a Bethesda game like Skyrim and Fallout\, and a Naughty Dog like Uncharted and The Last of Us. In the open world you can do whatever you want and go wherever you want\, however once you enter a story mission you have to go to a specific location doing a specific thing. There is no room for creativity from the player\, he's just following orders. I feel like if they would dedicate fully to the open world it would be much better. But looking at the critic reviews of the game I'm in the vast minority there. Don't get me wrong the gameplay can be very fun at points\, but I feel like it would be even better if I could control my character more and make my own decisions on how to approach a mission.The story is arguably the best part about RDR2\, and I think it has a very good story. Just to get started this story is really long\, it's about 50 hours\, but for most people like myself it took much longer than that because of side missions. Because of the length though I do think that the story can be pretty long drawn\, some missions are really boring and tedious but it is really saved by incredibly fun and epic missions. The story is separated into 6 chapters and then 2 epilogues afterwards. Each chapter spanning about 7-8 hours with chapter 5 being the shortest of the 6. The 2 part epilogue is roughly about 1 chapter in length. The length of the story has positives and negatives\, with the positives being more character development and more immersion\, but the negatives being that the pacing is pretty bad. But the story itself is very well told and Arthur Morgan has turned to one of my favorite video game protagonists of all time.To sum up this is a must play for any owner of a good PC\, PS4 or Xbox One\, and even though it's got its problems we have to appreciate that we don't often get this immersive and beautiful open world in a video game\, and accompanied by a well told story. I think everyone should at least try Red Dead Redemption 28/10… Expand",True,0.059479803,0.004272461,0.01374736,0.019934712,0.056441884,0.016292779

This ones easy and goes without saying. This is a 2018 game with amazing graphics-Plenty to do.  I was well into the 40+ hours before I even started the story :P yes\, thats the kinda guy I am. I started robbing\, trading\, hunting\, gathering\, exploring. Basicly anything I could do to see what could be done.-Gameplay.  This is a personal thing. ive seen some people complain. And though I agree to some extend...I think the game play is just fine. I like the snap-to-target mechanic. I mean\, i`m playing a bad ass and experienced cowboy. It should feel natural that I can mow down 5 guys withing a matter of seconds.  Struggling with the manual aim just feels unnatural and like an unrealistic handicap.-No bugs.  I have encounted NO bugs\, and only MINOR glitches. LIke\, this one time...Arthurs hand was clipping through his face during a dialoque with Dutch. But\, thats really it.no crashes....no freezes....No framerate issies....nothing. Runs smooth !Now\, THE BAD:-Chore.  And it does....it really does feel like a chore sometime. Skinning\, looting\, walking\, traveling. Yes\, arthus feels like a real bulky and heavy dude. But it does tire after a while to skin the same f***ing deer for (literally) the 60th time.-Frustrating. Sometimes you get stuck behind something. Or because of the complicated controls you prompt soms command you didn't want. Like jumping into cover instead of picking up a gun.It nothing major or game breaking. Just small annoyance that kinda stack up over time and become irritating.-Slow and Big.  The world is BIG. LIke\, it`ll take you a solid 10 min to cross the map from A to B.  Though I like the vastness and the regions to explore. It does get a bit annoying when you have to literally travel across the board to get a quest\, animal\, stranger request or something along those lines.The trains and the Coach fast travel system does offer some relief. I admit. But they never get you there all the way.  Horseback travel does feel kind of satisfyin though.  60+ hours into it at this point and it still doesnt bother me to ride.Like I said\, the game is not pefect. BUt I highly recommend.

Let down by dated\, poorly designed combat and missions but overall an incredible experience worth having.Most of your time in RD2 will be spent by riding your horse and listening to people's stories and that's not a bad thing. The world you're placed in is beyond anything anyone has made before. It's jaw droppingly beautiful.. Even after 60 hours in this game\, you will still be stunned by its visuals. It's made all the more satisying by having a horse that needs care and attention which makes you form a strong bond over the course of the game. The detail in the environment\, both wilderness and the towns are incredible. The immersion is helped by an interact button that lets Arthur (your character) either interact with someone positively or negatively.. its a small thing but helps make you feel like you're a living breathing person that can and does make an impact on the world around you. The actvities you can partake in \, like poker and blackjack in the local saloons are great\, especially when you enter firstperson mode. You can really take in the detail and more open world games need activities like this so you can interact with the world and people around you. As you progress through the game\, details will change also. Shops will get built \, some abbandoned and this happens in so many locations it's easy to miss as you play.The story is one of the best in recent gaming history. Arthur is a troubled man\, haunted by his past actions and slowly realising the selfish outlaw life he led has left him with nothing but blood on his hands. It's made all the more depressing by the fact you watch Arthur watch his friend and mentor Dutch \, slowly turn to madness\, becoming more reckless\, more violent and abbandon all previous morales (there wasn't many to begin with)Gameplay is RD2 biggest issue and one which divides it's playerbase\, you can either see past the outdated\, poorly designed shooting and mission design or you find it so irriating it ruins the experience for you. For me\, I was able to put it to the side for the previously mentioned positives. However\, it no less annoyed me and spoiled the experience.  When you're in a mission\, if you don't follow the instructions exactly\, you fail.. you fall too far behind your npc buddy.. you failed. You don't walk to the exact spot it marks on your mini map.. you can't progress. Rockstar games are no stranger to these issues and RD2 isn't the saviour to these glaringly outdated and poorly designed missions. It's a shame when the visuals and story telling around it are some of the best in the business. Next\, the shooting.. it's bad. It's a Rockstar game\, it's always bad.. it's bland\, easy and unimaginitive. Hold left trigger\, lock onto target\, pull right trigger.. I turned auto lock off and found the shooting to be a little more interesting but there's still a decent amount of auto locking on\, it's just not as strong.… Expand",True,0.20312156,0.010528564,0.022791367,0.06669625,0.12286829,0.016638106

76302,RDR2,2020-10-28,7.0,"Read Dead Redemption 2 is an average game.  Good in some areas\, but major flaws in others.* Good pointsGraphics - Some of the best graphics on the PS4.Game World - The game world is very immersive.  Animals behave realistically.  Towns feel very alive.Crafting/Survival - The game includes some basic crafting and survival mechanics which match the setting of the game.Story - The story is enjoyable and can be very thought provoking.  I found it interesting how Dutch has this self-delusion that he is a visionary being oppressed by the system when in reality he's just a charismatic thief and killer.  Eventually this delusion has major\, and very logical\, self-inflicted consequences on his gang.* Bad pointsControl - The game controls are frequently poor.  Every action is sluggish\, especially in combat.  There really is no excuse for the controls being this bad\, especially given the development time and resources.Weapon Selection Bug - Weapon selection seems bugged.  Actions like skinning an animal cause a seemingly random weapon to be selected instead of the previous selected weapon.  This will get you killed until you remember to check your selected weapon every time you do anything.  But since no other game works this way (that I know) you will continue to forget this bug/feature.Tedious Mechanics - The game forces you to craft/cook every item you don’t buy\, no way to stack and craft multiple items at a time.  If you’re crafting ammo for example\, you have to craft each bullet one at a time.  If you wanted to make 100 bullets\, you would have to craft each bullet one at a time!Crime System - Once spotted\, lawmen never stop coming after you\, their numbers are unlimited\, and they are virtually psychic.  Your only option is to try to outrun them.  This should not happen.  If you can’t kill all your pursuers\, they should at least come in waves which give you a reasonable amount of time to escape.Lack of Stores - The game has an odd distribution of stores.  For example; there appears to be only one wagon fence in the entire game.  Traders\, which have a number of unique items are poorly placed\, requiring the player to spend a lot of unnecessary time traveling.Poor Instructions - The game has a number of unique mechanics that are poorly explained.  Part of this is because the pop-up help appears in real time while you need to perform the action.  What the game should have done is introduce the game mechanics in a non-critical way BEFORE you actually need to use them (this is game dev 101).  In some cases the help is just wrong or incomplete\, requiring you to go online to get the information you need.  Gun duels are a primary example of this.  Players should never have to consult third party sources for basic game mechanics.There are a number of other poor design implementations not mentioned here.  However\, despite the games problems I still recommend people give it a try if you like sandbox games or westerns.  If good\, responsive control is important to you then you may want to wait and pick this game up used or in the bargain bin.… Expand",True,,,,,,

Graphically\, it's the best to date. It has a captivating\, exciting\, and fun story. RDR2 is incomparable\, Rockstar plays by its own rules\, competes against itself. Arthur Morgan is the best character that a video game company has ever created\, it's incredible how they deepen into his history and that of his gang\, the connection and attachment that's felt emotionally towards him during the story is something inexplicable\, I never thought that I would feel something like that towards a protagonist in a video game. In spite of everything\, you can see that several aspects to be polished were missing\, many times certain things about the gameplay are not explained\, or they end up being explained (rather understanding\, since they were never really explained) too much late. Also\, many times the game gets stuck during the missions\, your companions don't advance\, or they stay bug and you have no choice but to go back to the checkpoint\, which spoils the experience a bit. Despite having an excellent story\, it is noted that it is a bit hasty in the last moments. Another aspect that disappoints me a bit is limiting decision making. While some of your decisions change some scenes and very minimal aspects of the game\, although your decisions may change the ending you have\, they really do not have a great impact throughout the ENTIRE course of the story\, making it a totally linear game. You can see that it lacked a little more time to develop the game\, it lacked maturing. But considering that it is one of the first (if not\, the first) game with these brilliant and captivating characteristics\, it's understood in a certain way\, it only remains to keep improving. The truth is that I was impressed\, and I only think about the next installments\, and what will be learned and improved for the next games.ESPAÑOLMuy Buen Juego\, el mejor juego de la generación\, recomendable 100%.

A pesar de todo\, se nota que faltaron varios aspectos a pulir\, muchas veces no se explican ciertas cosas de la jugabilidad\, o se terminan explicando (mejor dicho entendiendo\, ya que nunca se explicaron realmente) demasiado tarde. También muchas veces el juego se queda pegado durante las misiones\, tus compañeros no avanzan o se quedan bugeados y no tienes  mas remedio que retroceder al punto de control\, lo cual arruina un poco la experiencia.

Se nota que le falto un poco mas de tiempo al desarrollo del juego\, le falto madurar. Pero considerando que es de los primeros (si no\, el primer) juego con estas características tan brillantes y cautivadoras\, se entiende de cierta forma\, solo queda seguir mejorando.

The player character feels a bit like the lumbering tank from the original Red DeadRed Dead Redemption 2 is one of gaming’s all time great achievements. Why not a 10 out of 10? Because the gameplay is rough and not up to modern standards.Before I wax ineloquently about the good\, let us dispense with the matter of the bad. Gunplay and movement in Red Dead Redemption 2 are not snappy. The player character feels a bit like the lumbering tank from the original Red Dead Redemption. Aiming with the left trigger doesn’t bring up iron sites but instead moves the tiny dot that serves as the crosshairs to the nearest enemy. This arcade like system is great for tagging enemies while riding on horse back but feels terrible when moving through an army like in a Call of Duty game. The game also offers a Max Payne like time slowing down mechanic called Dead Eye\, and if you have enough items to refill your Dead Eye\, you can easily headshot every enemy. Again\, the mechanic does not feel good when compared to modern shooters.The game will also frustratingly change the control schemes. Sometimes you press the right trigger to threaten someone with a gun. Other times\, pressing right trigger will cause you to shoot them in the face. The same goes for stealth kills. In the right context\, tapping the circle button will perform a stealth takedown or stealth kill\, and other times it will start a fist fight. I accidentally killed quite a few NPCs that cancelled a few optional mission paths because of the poor controls. Dear Rockstar: there is a good reason most games use the X button for contextual actions and not the button used to shoot guns!Some of the contextual controls are a little gimmicky and reminded me of Call of Duty or a story driven game like Heavy Rain. This is because Red Dead Redemption 2 is really a giant narrative game disguised as an open world shooter. The original Red Dead Redemption was my favorite game of the Xbox 360/PS3 generation because of its fantastic story and those quiet moments learning to ranch from Bonney or teaching those same skills to Jack. I could forgive the clumsy tank controls because the open world was liberating and I wanted to finish John Marston’s story. Red Dead Redemption 2 doubles down on the story and even expands on some of the trippy story segments in Grand Theft Auto V.Funny thing\, I was playing Life Is Strange 2 and felt the game was getting too real for 2020. So I bought Red Dead Redemption 2 for some good old fashioned cowboy shoot’m ups. Then Red Dead Redemption 2 lays on the contemplation of morality and regret. The game deals with respiratory disease\, parenting\, and bank loans! I felt like I needed a break from the all too real cowboy drama and played Overwatch for two weeks. Eventually though\, I came back to cowboy land and the story had me hooked. Eventually\, I finished the very long story after the second epilogue. What a ride.Like most people\, my play through was not 100%. I have nothing against the game for having too much content. Like The Witcher 3 and every Elder Scrolls game\, I have not desire to finish every fetch quest. Red Dead Redemption 2 offers hunting\, fishing\, scavenger hunts\, lots of bounties to collect\, and pointless conversation. The game also has old timey movies and “live” entertainment. At one time\, I might have been fascinated by all of the effort that went into the game. I might have loved the on-line game as pointless as it seems. As I become a cynical old man\, I lose interest in every nook and cranny of game. Still\, I appreciate the game as the total product\, and Red Dead Redemption 2 is the total product and then some. The game would have been well worth the original $60 asking price in 2018 and is well worth the $30 or less discount price today. You will be entertained.Rather than spoil the story\, I will simply say that it is Rockstar’s best\, one of the best in video games generally\, and even better than the original Red Dead Redemption. The vast voice cast and animation work make this world feel real. Some of the dialogue is definitely B work and not at all consistent with the time period. When it counts\, though\, the dialogue\, expressions\, and camera angles are spot on. Not every game can have such a monumental effort behind it because not every game will sell as well as Red Dead Redemption 2. I think of it this way: RockStar was going to sell a lot of copies of this game no matter what\, and they chose to make one of the best games ever made.All-in-all\, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must play\, and chances are you have already played it.… Expand",True,0.13214645,0.005683899,0.031980325,0.04442204,0.09001675,0.020782012

79232,RDR2,2018-12-31,10.0,"This is my favorite game of all time. The sheer amount of detail that Rockstar poured into this game is nothing short of incredible. While it is slow paced this game is nothing short of incredible. It is one of if not the best looking game of all time. The main protagonist\, Arthur Morgan is such an incredible character and I've seen many people that have not finished the game reviewing it and saying they didn't like him. But you must finish the game before you write a review because the way his character develops throughout the story is nothing short of amazing. You could be on your horse and suddenly a man collapses to the ground saying he got bit by a snake. And very minor spoilers: if you help him he will let you buy a gun and he'll pay for it when you see him again.I've never been so attached to a character in a game\, I guarantee you will create a bond with your horse. Your actions will determine what happens in the game as having high honor by helping people and more will give you discounts on things you need to buy. Rockstar has created such a great world that you will feel bad for doing bad things.  Now there is major Spoilers ahead so read at your own risk:At the beginning of the story Arthur Morgan seems like a forgettable protagonist. But as you go on he becomes a good man\, of course depending on your honor level. He grows when he sees the downfall of the gang and his diagnosis of tuberculosis. He realizes the mistakes that he has made and all the pain he has caused. At the end of the game you have two options\, you can go for the money or you can help John go to his family. reality starts to set in when Arthur realizes both of them aren't gonna make it and he sacrifices himself to help John return to his family. In the go with John ending which I picked\, you go through the mountains and help John as you hold off the Pinkertons. The ending depends on if you have high or low honor as having high honor will give Arthur a good death as he lays on the mountain watching the sunset and then dies. While having Low honor will result in you getting shot in the head by Micah. The ending made me cry and just showed how beautiful this game and it's story is. A masterpiece and I would 100 percent recommend buying.… Expand",True,0.049336795,0.003490448,0.008361516,0.020321451,0.040910475,0.011819307

In fact\, I feel like only this developer\, Rockstar Games\, is capable of delivering a title similar to this experience as their games in the last 15-20 have always set the standard for works that would follow at least a few years later. Now\, why I love this particular game and not just its developer. Firstly\, as it probably is the shortest one to cover\, let's talk technology - the game features the most outstanding graphics I have seen on a console\, and my mind can't comprehend how it runs so well. The animation work is beyond praise and all of graphical elements are top notch. The visuals create a rare sense or realism that greatly helps immersion. To top it off\, I have encountered very few glitches in what I presume to be more than 300 hours of play time. Next\, music - the score is wonderful and emotionally touching. The music dinamically underlines the gameplay and plays a crucial role in key story moments. It flawlessly fits the style and time period the game aims to portray and helps to establish a connection with the characters. Then\, the world - and oh my\, what a world this is! Probably the most amazing thing about Red Dead 2\, it is simply stunning and quite hard to conceive without having played the game. An unseen beofore level of interactivity\, creativity\, diversity and depth are what elevates this game's world above all others. Not to mention that it is incredibly large and filled to the brim with things to do. RDR2's world feels so lived in\, it is sometimes hard to distinguish from reality. Lastly\, the story. I think I have to take my words above back\, as this may actually be the best thing about the game. This narrative is something that transcends the field of game developoment\, as it is just on a whole other level\, able to fit into a movie studio or a writer's cabinet with ease. The characters are likely to be the best in gaming with depth\, personality and realism that befits only the best of modern writers. The story delivers an incredible amount of moral\, philosophical and emtotional dilemmas that can never cease to astonish me. The effort that has gone into establishing this detailed atmosphere with intelligent and meaningful character intreactions is unbelieavable and is probably why Rockstar Games\, and namely Dan Houser\, have been able to achieve such grand success and critical praise. The evloution and fate of the Van der Linde gang are very compelling\, absorbing and worthwhile. The game's protagonish is a very complex\, multi-faceted and engaging character who completely draws the player into his personal story as well as into that of his comrades. Starkingly humane at heart\, the story is based on both Romantic and Realist themes\, as well as some characterstic of Modernism. It shows a freat amount of research and devotion to authenticity. A pure masterpiece\, this is a game that would easily be enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike\, as it is truly and almost overwhlemingly a work of art.… Expand",True,0.054531995,0.004501343,0.011691323,0.020063626,0.048175167,0.01238892

Rarely have quit before finishing at least one run through. This is one I’ll never finish.I play/DM D&D in a group that has played since it came out in 1974. In 46+ years of DMing the most memorable campaigns and are those where I’ve set up the plot framework and let the players write the story and flesh in the details by their actions and choices. DMs running “dungeon crawls”\, and inflexible scripted rat maze adventures quickly found no one wanted them to DM. I’m also a writer. No author wants readers to stop and never finish their book. We all strive for \""page turners\"" that readers can't put down..1.	RDR2’s titanic failures start with its rat maze plot that Players have no influence over. Two alternatives to ONE ending? That’s inexcusable when RPGs like Witcher 3 have 36 possible endings and good reasons to play it many times.2.	Missions are also inflexible scripted rat mazes\, hence I stopped doing them in Chap. 2. They are like never ending poorly written tutorials. Chap. 2’s attack on an outlaw base is a perfect example. You’re forced to go in close handicapped with senseless tactics but you better keep your fellow outlaws alive or you fail and the mission restarts. I’ve since easily taken that base by myself using sensible tactics.I refused shake down Thomas Downes\, a sick farmer\, for his debt to Strauss. “My” Arthur is trying to redeem himself with a very high honor and would secretly pay the gang for Downes’ debt but that option is not allowed. You can’t mold Arthur they way YOU want. I resent that. I refused to do the mission but one time (while chasing a wild horse) I strayed too close and triggered it. I refused to follow through\, got the failed mission message and the mission restarted.I armed Arthur with preferred guns for a mission but the first cutscene put the inferior scripted guns back. Tried run to my horse to get the guns I wanted\, BOOM\, failure message pops up and am back to mission start. It’s literally like trying to control the outcome a bad movie by pushing the channel changer’s fast forward and reverse buttons. You have no control over how any of these missions play out.3.	The Challenges are tedious\, boring\, time consuming and not worth it. Why? Arthur can never get the ultimate reward for doing them\, Legend of the East outfit. I decided to get that outfit after abandoning the fun less missions. At least “I” could control that. I challenged myself to do them without getting bounties. NOPE! Can’t do that either! Some challenges require going into forbidden areas where an invisible sniper instantly kills you. It’s stupid!!! You only get the outfit at the game’s end when you can safely enter those areas at time when the outfit’s usefulness is moot. Why bother?4.	You can’t live a gang free life or have a love interest. I found a small empty cabin\, moved in intending to complete the challenges and never return to the gang. One day one of them rode up and asked if I was coming back. I wanted to say “No!” but that response was not a dialogue option.5.	Controls are crap! Some of the worst ever and that’s true whether using keyboard/mouse (me) or PS 4 controls (my son). Horses refuse to turn when you want them to\, crash into trees\, boulders\, wagons\, etc. Real life horses don’t do that. I rode horses all through my childhood and early adult life. Never once did one ram anything.6.	Aiming guns … how much worse could it be? That tiny little white dot often gets lost in the background making it impossible to aim and Dead Eye doesn’t help find the dot either.7.	Picking stuff up … POORLY done. You have to activate the tracking feature to even see items that can be picked up and then make wonky maneuvers just to position yourself for a pickup.8.	Getting to stuff you need in your saddle bags is VERY cumbersome. Where are the quick slots? I would have loaded them with horse reviver\, horse stimulator\, and tonics to refresh Arthur’s health\, stamina and dead eye to keep him and horse alive when on life support from a surprise ambush\, but to have to dig around to find that stuff ends in fatalities.9.	The bounty system is fatally flawed. Wonky controls and deliberate game scripts force unwanted fights. Ride or walk by someone while trying to talk friendly to them you will find RDR2 game script causing you to veer into and collide with the guy causing him to immediately start firing at or punching Arthur.  At other times Arthur suffers unprovoked attacks when fighting back is clear self-defense. It doesn’t matter. Fighting back is never self-defense and ALWAYS gets a bounty.

The graphics are one of the most visually stunning presentations of the whole franchise. I love how the sun shines through the trees on an early morning. The way you tread through the snow in the dark\, and the fire your carry gently glistens on the floor\, and how you ride into the sunset as the shadows of the mountains slowly cast upon. Those are small romantic moments that make this game absolutely memorable. The nature in this game is breathtaking\, it feels like that this could exist in real life. The character models are also excellently crafted.The soundtrack fits lovely into this world with slow guitar solos that emanate a typical westerns sound\, but still tends to be unique\, and have other lovely tracks that make the whole experience a wonderful journey.The gameplay itself is fine. You have a mass amount of activities to do like hunting wild animals\, skinning them and trading their fur for items\, going fishing\, playing poker\, chasing bounties\, searching for artifacts\, feeding your horse\, cleaning your horse\, buying guns\, polishing said guns\, maintaining yourself\, doing chores for your crew\, donating money for your crew\, helping your crew\, have you noticed a pattern right now?This game is pure micromanagement. Why must I clean my gun? Why do I have to skin animals? Why do I have to keep my horse happy? Why do I have to replenish every stat? I'm well aware of the reasons for these\, but it feels absolutely tedious having to do all these chores just for a minuscule reward.The actual gunplay is equally fine. It doesn't have anything unique to bring across the table\, which is not necessarily bad. I\, for one\, enjoyed the shooting\, the cover-system\, the use of the Dead Eye (even though I honestly wished they could have improved that better\, like regenerating itself without having to use medicine).Then there is another problem with this game and it's a major one: the story.The story itself is not bad. It's well written\, the characters and their development throughout the journey is intriguing. The problem\, however\, is the story keeps on going on and on\, drags itself continuously and when I think I'm close to an end\, it just keeps ongoing. I tried focusing only on the main quests and even then I still didn't come to a part where it felt like I was finally coming to a closure. The characters also claim to be one the best bank robbers in the world\, and yet half of their missions are botched that I honestly question their abilities.The reason I bought this game was because the majority praised the first Red Dead Redemption as one of the greatest games ever. And with the hype surrounding this one\, I wanted to be apart of this. I made a mistake with that assumption.Just to be clear\, the game is good for what it is. It does its job well\, however\, overstays it's welcome. If you are a fan of the first game\, then you will definitely enjoy this game. But if you dislike the Western genre and tried to see this as a part of the GTA experience\, then I would avoid this and just buy GTA.Good game\, unfortunately\, not my taste.… Expand",True,,,,,,

Most combat is something like beeing swarmed by 50 people\, which does not feel very realistic or very interesting. Game tries to aim for immersion\, but walking at crawl speed in camp areas\, slow transitions on fast travel\, crafting\, or even just using the interface can really strain patience.There are many side quests and random encounters to discover\, and they can be quite fun\, but you probably should stay away from all the other activities\, hunting\, fishing\, gambling\, challenges\, the collecting and the open world in general. Most are not fun and very\, very tedisome\, they take days of playtime to complete and give you hardly any interesting reward.

I was mentally \""RPing\"" every step of the way\, and taking my time in the world. The problem was\, the game began to stop me from acting on my natural instinct\, constantly making me do specific pre-defined paths (flanking is not an option sometimes). There isn't a \""true\"" obstacle that makes your plan fail\, the game simply ends the encounter. This design may seem archaic\, but I remember the missions in GTA 1-3 having more freedom.There are other moments where despite being in a dangerous situation\, escaping from the law\, heist\, or burning building\, when the character will walk inexplicably. It absolutely takes the pace to a grinding halt.The graphics\, the audio\, they feel right\, but the world feels like Disneyland. Tons of the open world quests are not well tuned. Example - I found an NPC in the world that creates a kind of mini-quest. We had to sneak up and hunt some animal that had stolen something from them or something. His lines were saying \""there he is\, ok\, lets sneak up on him..\"" something to that effect... and though I'm crouched and sneaking this NPC is just walking normally in front of me toward the prey. This was a random quest late game in the mountain area.The mini-game button mashing is extremely false feeling. It doesn't feel like youre \""really\"" doing that activity when youre holding R2 and spamming X or whatever it is.You will use your in-game money to purchase weapons\, customize them\, set up your loadout\, etc\, and go to a mission\, and then the mission begins and you suddenly are completely regeared\, and you arent with your horse. Just the default pistol with no rifle or shotgun... I dont understand why this would ever be done.The best part of this\, and I am being totally serious\, is Red Dead Online Poker. I have played a LOT of online video poker games\, and this is one of the most immersive and fun pvp poker games i've played no joke. Its awesome that you are your character\, and your winnings are going toward your RP journey.. its kind of awesome honestly\, Ive made a bunch of money to buy **** in RDO thru the poker haha...Im truly EXHAUSTED by the story\, and when you finish a mission you will often be at a point really far from your next mission spot... you can fast travel\, it takes a minute to crouch and set up camp\, and often it will say \""cannot fast travel with activities nearby\"" but I don't see anything on my radar... It happens so much that I dont even bother taking the time to get off my horse\, crouch\, camp\, etc (it takes a while and says 'activities nearby' about 75% of the time). I spend so much time riding horses across spaces...Overall the story arc is also badly paced. I dont want to spoil anything\, but just as the game is coming to a climax not only in plot points but in characters\, where they are kind of at each others' throats\, then you spend a LONG final act in a side story... it should have been incorporated into the main story FAR earlier\, and the side story been its own climax instead of something tacked onto the end. I dont look forward to the famously boring epilogue\, and I feel dead inside trying to finish and then I'm in a situation stuck walking\, or I fail a section because I try to be slightly creative with my approach... In conclusion\, I have to give a rating based on what the studio should be able to do. We shouldn't be easy on one of the most profit making companies in the business. Lets be honest about the quality of the narrative\, the lack of novelty at the systems\, the poor pacing in the action sequences\, the cover combat that was new in 2006 when Gears of War released.Graphics cant carry a game\, graphics naturally get better\, we cant clap our hands everytime it gets shinier and give it 10/10... cmon.… Expand",True,0.25462922,0.018836858,0.036878675,0.06599696,0.21024476,0.03856628

There are only a few games that manage to make you feel insignificant\, just as any other person in that world (at least for a while). Most games make you feel the entire world is created as a playground for you to enjoy. You have so many things to discover if you pay attention. So many things in the world hide clues for you to find\, so many random events make you feel the world is organic and believable. It isn't the classic open world where you have to climb somewhere tall in order to find everything you can do in an area and after you cleanup that area you go to the next area and so on. The beginning is a little bit slow but it serves as both a tutorial (since the game has a lot of mechanics that need to be learned) and an introduction to the characters and the relations between them. This makes me jump to the next category which is the story. To me the story was great especially because the game has multiple endings based on the way you play the game. However the story has 6 large chapters and after you finish the game they make you play 2 more Epilogue chapters which are again mostly tutorials in order to play one meaningful mission at the end. It was nice but it hurts the pacing. The game is heavily politicized but in my opinion it was all done pretty well and without ruining the overall immersion a lot. Personally I hate when games are pushing political agendas because games should be made to be fun not to preach you about all kind of things and especially when missions or characters are fabricated just to match the agenda they are trying to push. The graphics and sound are stellar. I couldn't believe how detailed everything is. Hands down to Rockstar for the huge effort they put into this game. The gameplay is fun but after a while you will see the mission structures bare the pattern. However you have a variety of weapons that you can choose from (all customizable) and after all this is what I expected from the game to be honest. Besides the story missions you have a lot of side missions that you can play and also a ton of side activities such as robbing people\, hunting or fishing.

The game is visually incredible. What the \""Pro\"" reviewers failed to point out are major flaws that you don't see until you have put a bit of time into the game.The controls are barely tolerable. Your character is forced to walk geriatric speeds in camp\, buildings\, and missions. This is the beginning of the frustrations. Moving on from that you have the lack of no real fast travel. The other faster methods of travel are often minutes away. Riding the horse gets old\, especially with it's affinity for going directly into trees.Half the missions are formulaic: take a long ride with heavy exposition from the NPCs\, who are also **** at you for not going exactly the right pace. Get to a token shoot out. Return to camp. This is interspersed with too many cut scenes. The over arching story is good but it's dragged out twice as long as it should be. A lot of the missions don't need any skill at all\, just press X or O when the game tells you\, follow the rails to the end goal.The side missions are a mixed bag. Poker\, Dominoes\, Blackjack\, just aren't worth playing because of how little they pay out and how long they take. Hunting is okay but it gets overly complicated with the game requiring you to craft special arrows and hit the animal at the perfect spot for the perfect pelt. Bounties are fun\, fishing is fun. Looting turns into a chore. Holding X for 2 seconds each time and lining up your character just right so you see the dialog box gets old FAST. Doesn't help also  when NPCs are around rushing you.aMy eyes were telling me this game is incredible. However every time I put down the controller I didn't feel much of an urge to pick it back up. If anything the game feels more like a second job than a fun time. You literally would need a notepad/to-do list to be able to complete some of the challenges. Rockstar forces you to play the way it wants.

76471,RDR2,2020-07-28,8.0,"This game is awesome. These beautiful horns start up as Arthur rides through the blizzard and over the mountain with wind chimes twinkling in the background. It’s just 3 seconds in and I already am in love with this game. But what’s even crazier is that it gets better. The characters in the gang are complex and interesting. They all feel real distinct and all are attempting to find their way in a rapidly changing America. They’re all complicated and layered people and watching them all interact in the camp is so interesting. The camp\, by the way\, is awesome. Like Zelda\, there are so many little details in this world that encourage you to just watch your surroundings. Your reputation changes with your actions in other towns\, shopkeepers will be short with you if you’re known for stealing in a town. The characters all have their own schedules that are dynamic and can change with rain or as the story develops. They’ll play poker with each other\, they’ll have drinks\, they’ll get into arguments\, they’ll fight\, even their actions on their own are consistent with their character. Like Dutch can be found sometimes listening to classical music because he’s idealistic and believes in elevating himself. A lot of nights you can find them telling stories around a campfire. Even these minor side characters in the towns are developed in ways most other games don’t even try to do. These poker players in this town are just total dickheads. These two psychos murdered their mom and will try to rob you. People will actually react if you steal their horse and then return it to them later. There are a ton of little details sprinkled throughout the world that encourage you to press and probe it for little secrets and try to uncover what happened in these mysterious\, creepy places. The story\, too\, is extremely strong. Each mission keeps building on the last by fleshing out these characters further and continuing to test their limits as the ties of the gang are strained and everyone just tries to hold on to what they care about before it all comes tumbling down. Despite their flaws\, I truly cared about and loved these characters which made their circumstances all the more tragic. In the first half of the game I was completely enthralled\, there were so many iconic moments and then D’Angelo came in here with Unshaken and I was floored. I could not wait to see what was next. Then: chapter 5 hit and all of the forward momentum of the story completely stopped and then for the rest of the game meanders towards a weak conclusion. And as the story started to falter a lot of other issues started to show for me as well. The cover system feels ancient\, a lot of the game is spent just riding around on a horse\, the combat gets a little repetitive as it just feels like one shooting gallery after another\, and there are just not that many ways to approach the missions in the game. If the combat was just a little bit more dynamic than sitting behind cover or if there were more ways to approach missions then the weaker segments of the story would be forgivable but as it stands there is a dramatic drop in quality from the first half of the game to the second. Still\, even the weaker segments in this game have some good moments in there and I wouldn’t even classify them as bad just weaker than the rest of the game. I would rather play the second half of this game than most other games this year. Definitely right now I’m going to give Red Dead 2 an 8 out of 10\, but when I replay it that might bump it up to a 9 for me.… Expand",True,0.07687678,0.005645752,0.021585498,0.023479814,0.084844165,0.013631714

Hunting\, the random encounters\, dialogs\, everything makes you feel like you are an actual cowboy progressing into the story.Of course every game has it cons. The single player is fun but sometimes is not a challenge at all. Some missions are just to easy (certainly with auto aim on) The inventory system is kinda clunky. Sometimes I end up picking the wrong item\, sometimes I end up not picking an item at all even though I did select it. Next to that comes the endless horse riding in missions. I get it riding a horse is fun\, but almost every mission is going to bore you out quite quick. Next to that comes that the law is on you so quick. Even with making the slightest movements a bounty will be set on your head. I gathered a large bounty now which makes the game less fun since I need to be careful all the time.Overall the game is awesome for the casual player that likes to do random stuff and that likes to explore the beauty of the in-game world. On the other hand sits that the game lacks challenge now and then and that some of the basic in-game functions are clunky at times. Looking for a game to get soaked in and play hours of exploring?

The dialog options alone are very good and the ways Arthur can interact with the enviroment makes this game feel real and alive.Controls are a bit clunky\, like in many other Rockstar games\, and the downside of the many options that are given to you is that you don't always take the action that you wanted to. It takes time to get used to but once you do is not so bad.  The map being so big you're also going to spend a lot of time going from one place to another and even if random events and the beautiful world make it mostly entertaining\, it does get annoying sometimes. This could have been easily fixed with a better fast travel system. Also the crafting and updates relies too much on hunting.All in all it is a great game and everything I hoped it would be even if it's not the perfect game some people claim it is.

But there are a couple things that I have a chip on my shoulder about\,I'm going to be focusing mostly on the negatives from here\, because everything good to be said about this game has been said a million timesLet's start off by saying that all the characters are brilliant\, I'm impressed by the attention to detail\, the story & amazing level of realism that's pretty rare these days. But there are a couple things that I have a chip on my shoulder about\,I'm going to be focusing mostly on the negatives from here\, because everything good to be said about this game has been said a million times over\, & it's had it's fair share of praise\, as evident in the 97 metascore.This game can get exhausting and there are often points where it's just plain boring. The missions are pretty much go somewhere\, have an auto-aim shootout\, go back to camp. And it takes a hell of a long time from start to finish\, mostly riding your horse and watching some pretty boring cut scenes. It's tiresome and sluggish to do anything. Some of this is down to the realism\, and I've seen this issue being spat about left right & centre. Say what you will about it\, I agree with points made on both sides but sometimes\, it really adds to the headache. That isn't to say it isn't an impressive and commendable feat\, you just end up feeling like '...f**k really?' when these things come up.The Ui and controls are outdated and outright bad. Hard to use\, finicky\, overbearing and all round appallingly designed.  What is up with we having to hold buttons instead of just tap? It's use is extremely excessive\, & the time it takes to do every little thing adds up to a game that already takes it's time with everything else.As for the other controls  - who the hell designed it to be like this? They are tragically bad\, hard to learn and awkward. UI never ceases to be difficult to navigate. The controls aren't too bad when just milling around the world\, but when you get in to it there are multiple situations where the poorly designed controls stick out like a sore thumb. A few instances are:Arthur's inventory - you can't really get an idea of what he's carrying\, and it's really difficult to understand how it works.When in combat (especially close combat)\, the horrible controls really make themselves known . The movement is so slow\,  difficult to control\, the camera is all over the place because you need your fingers in five other different places. Don't even get me started on fights on horseback\, when you're asked to keep up with something/someone whist being told to protect them and defeat all your enemies. it means you need to steer your horse\, repeatedly tap X to keep up with the speed\, control your camera\, and shoot people coming at you from all different angles including behind you and above you.The story was excellent: emotional\, raw\, and an excellent array of characters to play off.  However\, I feel as though the fact that it took place in a open world deducted from it a lot\, because players were free to do main story missions whenever they like. And for most players\, they would be doing side quests between a lot of those missions because everything on the map is grabbing for your attention. This completely messes up the pace of the story. I also felt that the story only really picked up at around chapter 4. Before that\, there wasn't t any growing conflict between Dutch and Arthur\,  it was simply: \""we'll do another job and we'll have enough money to disappear!\"" and Arthur went along with it without question until Dutch starts losing it\, which isn't until the very latter parts of Arthur's story. So that resulted in nothing really happening for the first half of the game.  While I respect and love the open world that has been created\, it feels as though if telling a great story is your main priority\, you should probably use a closed world.The game flits from holding your hand and treating you like an idiot\, to leaving you completely in the dark about very important things\, if that makes sense.All in all\, the massive\, throbbing\, issues with this game are due to bad execution of an otherwise excellent and superb open world game. These are fixable issues that aren't fundamentally deep rooted in the game. They could have been fixed prior to release with a bit more time\, innovation and intuit. The game is an great achievement for Rockstar\, but it could have been 10-fold better with some more time to shift a couple things around.… Expand",True,0.104361884,0.006790161,0.034300596,0.026831545,0.080318145,0.0287245

I would have added a pre-blackwater chapter in the game and removed chapter 5. The transition between outlaw to seeking \""redemption\"" is very blurry and rushed. Narrative really only gets going at the final chapter.TLDR: I loved RDR 1 & 2 and really enjoyed what they did with this game. I do think Rockstar focused much on realism and the world\, causing the story to fall short.

76588,RDR2,2020-07-03,8.0,"Note: I'm writing this review several years after its release\, but I have recently replayed it.RDR2 is one of the few games I have ever been so excited about releasing that I made sure I had it on release day. I spent the next few weeks in my college apartment playing the game - fully immersed in the story and world it created. It helped spark my passion for visiting the western parts of the United States - and took me into a world I could only dream of.Gameplay (7/10): Sometimes was a little clumsy\, sometimes got stuck in places\, sometimes experienced some glitches and bugs. Can't tell you how many times I accidentally shot someone while trying to tuck a gun away or just pull it out to be prepared. Could use some updates and user-friendliness\, but nothing I can complain about here. I for one enjoyed the realism - side activities were plentiful (as is standard with Rockstar) - and having to cut hair or eat to survive was understandable. I personally dislike games where health automatically replenishes over time. Also didn't mind riding horses and trains around - for goodness sake its the 1800s - fast travel can wait. As always - Rockstar is king of the hill when it comes to open-worlds - and this one was epic.Graphics (10/10): One of my favorite things to do in the game is look up at the night sky on a clear night with no moon and be amazed by the stars and Milky Way. The world was beautiful\, filled with lots of different areas to explore and see. Realism abounds\, and I still enjoy looking at screenshots from this one.Story (9.5/10): A long story\, but that was fine with me. As usual Rockstar has many\, many\, many side missions you can complete\, some with a few funny moments and cool experiences. I enjoyed playing these the most on my second play through\, as they allowed me to experience the game differently. Like RDR - characters die midway through the game. I loved Arthur Morgan's character (more than John Marsten) and was sad when he left - the storytelling helped show the struggles he faced\, and his personal conflicts that made him into a character I loved.Some of the missions did seem repetitive in nature\, and as the gang was dissolving I wished it could have dissolved quicker - Lord knows I had had enough of Dutch's \""one more job\"" and \""have some faith\"" - but that shows the story was working.… Expand",True,0.049089402,0.003414154,0.016762028,0.02012808,0.055940874,0.013269233

The characters & writing are great. The story\, whilst starting off a little too slow is very enjoyable. The customisation for yourself\, weapons\, horses\, camp etc is deep. I spent 30mins yesterday just customising my weapons.I like how realistic the game can be\, hunting/supplying & working around your camp to get the best out of it. The fact you look after Arthur whether it's eating/resting/washing/shaving etc. It's never once felt like a chore or something\, it's just something you do once in a while that has an effect on the game & helps break the missions apart with a greater feeling of a realistic game world.I do think Arthur's movement is slightly too heavy & slow. It's not bad\, it could just be slightly less & still retain the same feeling of a realistic movement system. Lastly\, controls. There's controls galore\, it does feel overly complicated with so many different controls to remember & then on top of that with so many different weapon wheels\, crafting options\, item menu's\, dialogue menu's etc. i'm often pushing the wrong buttons or being caught out when the game wants you to be using the dialogue menu whilst a fire fight breaks out. I do see how in some ways it adds to the game\, making it a little more complex & it doesn't really lessen my enjoyment however a choice of a simpler system would've been nice.But overall i'm really loving this game.

Bloody gorgeous. There is so much detail. Every bottle\, bush\, floor tile\, brick\, lamp post\, plant\, pipe is modeled and textured immaculately. It's so immersive. A couple of times I was in awe. The mid-19th century interior of the mansion in Saint Denis is incredible. I wanted to just walk around inside. The chandeliers were beautiful. The stage show cinema! Really cool. Graphics are A+.Sound is good as well. The score is good. The few country tracks aren't my taste but the final mission score and end credits score were great.The story is alright. Voice acting was great. Good dialogue for the most part. Many scenes had me laughing. Although\, I found Arthur annoyingly goody-too-shoos by the end of it. Well\, it is called red dead redemption after all. But still...And now the major issue: Gameplay. Looking through the end credits it's very hard to believe so many people worked on the gameplay. There's gotta be some money laundering going on or something. Rockstar went too far to the side of realism and animations. It would have been better if the controls were more responsive. All those years prior Rockstars own Max Payne has more responsive control. All they had to do was elaborate on those. Add contextual animations maybe but you have to keep the responsiveness. Never annoy the player. That's like gameplay 101. The gameplay is too lumbering as it is. I found myself overshooting destination objects or taking cover in spaces I didn't want or just struggling with generally unresponsive behavior sometimes. Melee combat was pretty pathetic. Mash square to block/dodge\, circle to attack\, rinse repeat.Other annoying gameplay mechanics (or lack thereof):-game doesn't make not use of of PS4 gyro. I don't care if hardly any 3rd party devs use it\, it's there\, it makes the experience better\, USE IT. Right thumbstick for large\, coarse movements\, gyro for finer\, granular aiming. Common sense. But no\, only Nintendo has the intelligence to come up with that. Well\, now it should be the standard. And if any other game after Breath of the Wild doesn't use gyro for aiming it's a FAIL.-when I place weapons on my person\, they should be on my person AT ALL TIMES unless specified otherwise. The game decides that any weapon that's not in your holsters\, will be put on the horse whenever you ride the horse\, so you may or may not have to reequip them\, it seems random or after a long time. Stupid. Speaking of which\, don't auto choose what weapon is good for me for a mission. Let me figure it out\, Tell me what the situation is through the characters then I can decide what the best weapons for the job are. Another common sense thing not implemented so it's a failure of basic common gameplay sense.RE: saving and dying. I would have preferred if the game was more like an RPG\, where when you die\, it's game over. You must reload. It takes away from the immersion when you die and you just start again nearby. There's little consequence for dying. It's just annoying. But very annoying because sometimes you fight in some random event\, die and can't get back to that event with no chance to redo it. All Rockstar had to do was to allow random events to be replayed like missions and/or have the game auto-save BEFORE events so you have a chance to redo them. Also the game should save like an RPG where it saves your exact position and the exact state of the game world so you can reload and choose to do things differently to see what happens. Hopefully future Rockstar games can be like that.I wish the morality system made more of a difference like Knights of the Old Republic. I wish there were different endings and missions depending on how you play -- good guy or bad. I get that there is only 1 true story but more games should scrap that. Games are not movies.Zooming in and out of the map is painfully slow. The way fast traveling is presented is also a failure. I don't remember the names of the places. Just show me a map of where the place I can go to actually is so I can see how close it is to where I need to go. Use the same map screen from the options menu. This is common sense so that's just complete laziness.Oh\, also there's no way to get rid of weapons you don't want. You have to scroll through all the crap you pick up and you'll be doing that a lot because the game doesn't keep the weapons you choose on your person. Which is just dumb.Oh and the idiocy of making the player do the mundane tasks like building a fence or whatever. Just cut to the end of the scene. Don't make the player do that sh*t. What're you drunk? That's a waste of development time.Despite these gripes\, the game is still very immersive. For the most part I enjoyed it but it could have been better.8/10… Expand",True,,,,,,

Weather effects and lighting make the game shine\, the photo mode is a great addition and some landscape shots can look extremely lifelike. StoryThe story is one of the most important things to me in a game and lots of people think the story is perfect but I unfortunately have to disagree. I found the pacing off\, the missions repetitive and not very interesting. I struggled to care for the characters as there is such a large cast\, it’s difficult to get to know everyone. Hosea stood out to me and was my favourite aside from Arthur but even when he was killed I still didn’t feel much because you hardly spend time with these character outside of missions. And when the story took us to Guarma it just seemed like unnecessary padding. The voice acting is good\, sometimes great. But even the best voice actor can’t make a clearly animated model feel like a real flesh and blood character you love. I also have an issue with how rockstar design missions. There’s no freedom in how you do things. It’s “Do this\, go here\, open this\, shoot him\, now go back here.” Even in Linear games such as uncharted or god of war\, you have a choice of how to go about things\, but here you have to follow rockstars instructions to the letter or you fail the mission. I got most of my enjoyment out of exploring the world and doing my own thing in game rather than the story. If I had to sum it up\, rockstar have made their best open world to date and it is something truly amazing in that regard....but at a cost. A lack of polish on core game mechanics like controls\, mission design and story pacing effect the game as a whole.

Simply too many regressions.I have give RDR 2 score 3 out of 10 for the following reasons.First of all\, the control is simply dispointing. It takes forever for the character to respond to my control input. When trying to fire your weapon quickly. I need to pull trigger twice\, first was for fireing\, seconds was for reload the second round. I can't reload last check point if I didn't commit suicide. The save game and load game options are so hidden in the menu. I can't remember how many time I  need to call my stupid horse so I can fetch weapon\, since getting off horse doesn't gurantee the weapon is with me. The list goes one.Second\, this game is advocated for being realistic. I don't see a lot realism in the game. Let's take a look how stupid the lawman is in this game. If I ran into others on the horse\, the law man shoots me. If ganster shoots me\, lawman ignore. If I figth back\, lawman shoots me. If lawman is fighting ganster and gets killed\, other lawman saw the body of the lawman. Yes\, you guess it\, they will shoot me. And in this wild west\, it seems lawman has telephones and portal so once I became wanted\, they can be emerging from anywhere from the maps. Are you kidding me? I can't tell how many time I have been chased out of Saint Denis for those morrons\, so I wouldn't be able to start a mission. And I can't buy a weapon in the store because they are locked? That's the realism I got\, even I am rich as hell.Third\, the horse is stupid as stupid. I have to get the horse brush through main mission\, otherwise I can't even brush my stupid horse? That's really nice design there\, especially considering the pace of the game is so slow. And the only reason the horse can be killed\, is very apparently that\, it will be needed in the end game. So they can bring more sentimental thing in the game.Four\, I found it very hard to justify for the cost to develop this game. 8 B and 2000 people worked on it for eight years? That's what we got? Not happy about that. It's still very hard for me to believe to add the black border like a movie\, they have been over work for a few monthes\, and redid all the cg.

I was a huge massive fan of red dead redemption 1\, the problem with red dead redemption 2 is easily to say\, they focussed too much on realism and not gameplay. Overall I want to say the gameplay is very clunky and litteraly unplayable. Is this game fun to play? yes if u like watching a movie and want to live inside a game and eat apples/feed ur horse and threathe it like an survival game.. Since this release of RDR2 I have no faith in rockstar games anymore\, they will focus again on online\, battle royale\, and to make profit from it. My question is here: Do game companys care about gamers? No\, only a few companys do but not the large ones anymore. They just want to see how much money u have in ur wallet\, anyways the game red dead redemption 2 I was very hyped for is just a clunky\, buggy open world game\, without real living things and it is very very unoptimized\, it feels like the game is released in beta/alpha state. The main character arthur morgan is okay\, but very boring to play aswell\, the huge problem with red dead 2 is that u cant play it as an ''GAME''\, it is like an movie\, because everytime when u want to start a mission u enter very long cutscenes\, the only few things u do is shooting/ horse riding actually. Those meta scores of this game are way too overrated\, im like serious 9\,7 from 33 critics? did those reviewers got paid by rockstar? Gamers should rise up and stop those dumb ''casual'' game releases\, what I want to say at last is : focus on this when u make an great game: Story > gameplay > open world > character design > mission design > and at the last GRAPHICS\, GAMES are not about GRAPHICS\, and YES im glad that God of War won the game of the year award\, I would be ambarassed if god of war did not win the GOTY\, because God of War is an REAL game\, Not an MOVIE.… Expand",True,0.20032968,0.015609037,0.03223813,0.047935467,0.14313951,0.03649433

76800,RDR2,2020-07-01,6.0,"I’ve struggled with doing this review for a long time because everyone that I know that has finished the game say it’s a masterpiece and should have been GOTY. The truth is\, for me\, it just really doesn’t hold up. If you love RDR and think it was a game changer story and gameplay wise\, you will see that almost 10 years later\, it’s the same game. I’ll try to be brief but consistent with the strengths and weaknesses of the game. Let’s start with the strengths: - Graphics\, it does look amazing\, but somehow the world didn’t invite to explore (like LoZ: BOTW did; the world Rockstar created didn’t offer a lot of reward for exploring. Just a few Easter eggs or someone to shoot down\, nothing intriguing or fascinating\, so a no from me. But I can’t deny it doesn’t look **** good. - Character Acting\, the actors did a really\, and I mean a really good job with acting. - Music\, enough said. - Models\, lighting and technical stuff. Rockstar obviously know what they are doing\, a AAA game should be up to date or maybe set the bar higher\, which it did. - Attention to Detail\, it is amazing how much stuff you can do in this game. And how much attention to detail went to it\, from gun cleaning\, to riding horses\, to peeing drunk\, to the environment\, to everything; everything is top notch. Weaknesses: - Controls. Oh boy\, my rant about the controls is really something that bothers me. I can’t believe that a game from 2018 has the same controls as GTAIV. IT’S BEEN 10 years Rockstar. It’s clunky\, un-smooth\, weird\, not intuitive and damn right infuriating at times; if I could give 0/10 to something in this game would be the **** controls. It’s just bad\, like really bad. - Horse riding. There’s a good percentage of the game that you just go from one location to the other\, with no music and no nothing. It’s almost as if Rockstar wanted you to do the cinema mode and watch Arthur ride a horse\, also the bad thing is that there’s little to no music while doing this. There were many times were I put my controller down and started looking at my phone. - Story. I know\, I know. People love this story\, but I don’t. If I wanna play through the story of a cowboy\, whose somewhat of a good guy who has done bad stuff\, or maybe will do bad stuff to get what he wants\, I wouldn’t play RDR2. There’s a far better execution of a similar story\, and that’s RDR. At times I knew what was going to happen and I always kinda knew what kind of guy Arthur was. The others members of the gang didn’t really interest me\, or I didn’t have any type of investment in them. For me\, they were bland and uninteresting; except for Arthur or Sadie. Dutch just kept saying “I have a plan” and the story was “New Camp\, don’t do bad things until you did bad thing. Chased\, maybe someone died and New Camp”. Rinse and repeat. - AI\, or Law system. The game\, as other GTA’s tries to tell you that you can do bad things and have fun\, you know Rockstar stuff. But in this game even when I wasn’t trying to do bad things or defending myself\, I had like 20 lawmen on my ass which was really annoying. Sometimes I couldn’t do a story bit because there was always a witness. Sometimes I would rather not do anything bad at all so I would have to deal with the law after\, because in this game it’s really\, really annoying killing sheriffs only for far more to appear. - The shooting. It’s helped aim and everything comes down to shooting. You don’t need many guns\, just a rifle and a revolver and you can win everything. I didn’t clean my weapons because it didn’t feel necessary\, they worked and they got the job done. If you read all that\, thank you\, in conclusion I just want to say that RDR2 is not a bad game in any means; but it also isn’t ground breaking or offers anything new or better that we haven’t seen before. All that detail to me seems wasted\, like you don’t need to eat really\, you don’t need to clean your horse or your pistols\, you don’t need to hunt or explore. You could just do all the missions and the story would be the same\, it seems like Rockstar just put the “open world” to please fans and remind you that Rockstar makes sandbox open world games. Story-wise I thought it was bland and predictable\, it had it’s awesome moments but nothing worth remembering. The controls are just a **** mess and hope that they DO understand they need a change for future games. For me it’s a 6/10\, this is a world I would not like to revisit\, I prefer RDR\, BOTW or Horizon. People should really try to keep an unbiased view and play other things before calling them a masterpiece. Hope this review helps you somehow\, and if you still want to play the game\, I don’t blame you\, maybe you’ll have a better time than me. Just wait until it releases on PC or the price is down.… Expand",True,0.0969861,0.0044441223,0.012139536,0.028832749,0.072882555,0.010757755

Did anyone think maybe the player isn't interested in hitching his horse on the post in a VIDEO GAME. Anyway now we sit and watch for a bit more and then there's a gun fight. With possibly the worst control scheme I have ever experienced I manage to wield my gun and take out some people who I have no idea why we are killing and then we explore the house they were living in. We find out they killed some guy and I go to check out the barn and then some guy jumps on me and after an extremely drawn out fight I have to interrogate him by choosing whether to talk to or hit him.Now all of that done with\, some more cut-scenes and now we are free to do as we please. Wild west here come. Or so I think. That however won't be the case because there's missions to be done. In fact it would seem the game is primarily about doing missions. So we start the next mission. Now we are walking/riding at nought miles an hour trying to shoot a bow while our character cant keep the bow still to save his life. Oh and then the aim-assist kicks in when the target starts moving. Which is it going to be noodle arms or auto aim? Keep in mind this isn't while it's drawn back just holding it he can't keep it still. He seems to be able to hold the gun still just fine. So now I've killed the deer with no help from the wildly inconsistent controls and  now I have to wait for my horse to return while I hold the deer on my shoulder. Wouldn't you just wait until your horse returned and then pick it up? What's the point in making an open-world game where you utterly on rails and the game play is utterly laborious? Do Rockstar only play their own games so they've never heard of a thing called an RPG? Don't they realise players aren't horses and don't need to be led by a rope to their hitching post?

But almost without fail every mission ends in disaster no matter how well or badly you play it till your character finally just dies (after contracting tuberculosis so you have to endure listening to him cough constantly for the final weeks of his wretched life). Then you start over again as a different character and have to apparently do it all over again.I'm quitting at 72% completion of the story line because this is so horrible.Note to game developers: If you're going to create a game where the player is meant to meticulously build up skill trees and work to develop an arsenal of more and more effective weapons until they can take on the more difficult challenges in the game\, DO NOT\, please please please DO NOT then put the character into a situation where you take all their weapons and ammo and money and skills away so they have to manage without them.I HATE THAT!!!!!!!!They did it in Breath of the Wild with that island that mysteriously makes all your weapons disappear.

Here are a few:Characters/Story: I'll start out by saying this - yes\, the story is a bit predictable but only because if you played the first RDR\, you know where some of these characters end up. (I'm only mentioning this because I've seen quite a few reviews harping about the story's \""predictable\"" timeline). And while I agree that it's pretty easy to see where it's going by the time you're about halfway through\, it's how we get there that defines this campaign's prestige. I've never been so engulfed by the main character(s) of a video game and their stories than I was with Arthur Morgan and the rest of the gang. Their histories\, friendships\, inside jokes\, and personalities are all encompassed throughout the story\, and it all culminates to a fitting\, beautifully written ending in the final chapter. I felt like I was really a part of this gang and it brought out real emotions when something happened\, good or bad. The cut scenes are breathtaking\, and sometimes it's easy to forget that you have a controller in your hand because of Rockstar's commitment to a cinematic experience. The story is rich from start to finish\, and even after hundreds of hours playing\, you will only be wishing for more.Setting: I'm sure everyone has heard about the size of RDR2's map by now. And the beauty. So I won't go on and on about it. It's huge. It's breathtaking. It's gorgeous. And at times\, it's even terrifying. No other game lives up I will promise all new players one thing. You will have AT LEAST one (probably more) moment during your campaign\, where you stop for a minute or two and just say to yourself \""Damn\"". For me\, it was the first thunderstorm I witnessed while I was roaming the plains and the first time I trotted into bustling Saint Denis.Details: Pay. Attention. It's not super critical to the advancement of the main plot\, but you WILL be rewarded with hints\, theories\, and simply entertaining interactions if you pay attention to things like background conversations\, posters on walls\, animals in the distance\, etc. For example\, there's a background convo in one of the towns where 2 neighbors argue about a barking dog that makes me crack up every time. If you're one that likes to flesh out little details like this\, you will be rewarded!I could go on and on. I've already remembered several things to add to the paragraphs above\, but for the sake of time and character-length I will leave those things for you to discover. I will just leave you with 7 simple words that my best friend gave me almost 2 years ago. YOU SHOULD BUY RED DEAD REDEMPTION TWO.

Your character is a rough criminal gang member named Arthur who's the shoot/punch first\, ask questions later sort of person although with the honor system you can somewhat tame his nature with time if you choose to be a more honorable person.The graphics are breathtaking\, the vista's and weather effects not to mention the attention to detail are top quality and this was never a problem\, the sound effects are perfect too.   The voice acting honestly gets annoying sometimes though\, as most of the time its just characters complaining and whining on how life is mistreating them and so forth.The story itself\,  honestly?  Its good\, its a believable story which portrays just how bad things was over hundred years ago\, the story does have portions where it feels slow-paced though and that kinder makes the player sometimes get a bit burned out and feeling bored\, especially having to travel on horseback for a significant amount of time...hey\, at least the scenery looks great!.. thats assuming your not killed on-route due to either glitches\, or random 'pop up' bandits that seem to literally spawn out of thin-air sometimes and break the immersion entirely.On-to the meat of the game and that's the gameplay....this is where most reviewers honestly have no clue how to accurate review a game\,  graphics etc are important factors...but gameplay is the most important factor\, and bugs/glitches that impact said gameplay must be taken into account and this is where RDR2 suffers and honestly should loses valuable points\,  the game is BUGGY - its no real surprise since the original was a bugfest as well\,  this is just as bad unfortunately.The bugs\, glitches and gameplay issues are numerous and highly affect the gameplay\,  it is quite possible to die many times through absolutely no fault of the player\, you literally can't even leave the game running to go to the bathroom without getting back to find your character either dead or has a bounty EVEN in the so-called safety of towns\,  case and point ~  the law system is so stupid that if an NPC even so much as walks into you its considered 'disturbing the peace' and thats an immediate crime and a bounty\,  basically towns are in someways more dangerous than open country because of some jackwagon NPC walked into you or your horse\, or your running around or travelling too fast which instantly spawns lawmen out of thin air shooting at you with fairly high accuracy.The inventory system and control system isn't very good either\, most of the time you are given just a small pop-up with a very brief explanation of a control system\, which progressively gets more confusing\,  sometimes the control system directly gets in the players way when you are trying to equip a gun/heal in a pinch as the main culprit here.In a nutshell\,  the game is a flawed gem that can be alot of fun to play\, but can also be highly frustrating and yelling at the TV inducing too\,  does this game deserve 8+ reviews? No no no\,  its above average that is for sure\,  honestly ~ this game would play so much better on keyboard+Mouse controls.… Expand",True,0.22311419,0.007171631,0.017766917,0.0811385,0.09034003,0.00951496

It excels in a way where people are not able to mention many (or any) other game with such a story and level of detail. The writing of the characters is fantastic\, just to mention my absolute favorite\, Dutch\, and the main protagonist Arthur. By fact\, Dutch’s charisma makes him my all time favorite video game character. From beginning to end\, following him and his community/gang in the eyes of Arthur Morgan is a unique experience that no other game has been in a position to be. Artistically speaking\, I cannot think of something that is not perfect with RDR2. The whole decently large open-world is visually stunning\, full of random events and things to explore. It would take a while for a novice gamer to notice any pattern of similarities. That’s what crazy about RDR2: detail. Visuals\, sounds\, interactions with the world (to and from)\, everything is made with an extreme level of detail and finesse. That aspect of the game helps immersing the player as from the beginning\, and might improve retention during the slow first 2-3 chapters.In what regards the gameplay\, the result is very good as well. Character handling\, horse handling and weapons all feel nice. It’s not overly responsive\, but just enough to have a good gaming experience without ruining immersion/realism. In terms of things to do\, I wasn’t bored for a second during my progression. There are so many things to do in RDR2 without ever feeling repetition. However\, once the main game is finished (main missions + honest deal of side missions/activities) what’s left to grind for is repetitive. All that said though\, I can easily conclude that RDR2 is one of the best solo games I have ever played.That brings me to my next point which is where I think R* screwed up: Red Dead Online. I am one of those players who at this day still consistently plays GTA Online because of how good it is (sure has defaults and things we hate like all those OP too unrealistic vehicles\, but I cannot lie to myself\, I’ve played it hundreds of hours). GTAO has an extremely developed free roam mode\, with constant major updates and a ton of things to own and grind for. It also has a ton of lobby based activities among which some are now already pure classics among my circle of friends (Sumo\, Offensive Defense\, etc). I close the parenthesis which introduces my point: RDO terribly lacks of content. My friends and I were hoping for so much\, we imagined crazy ideas based on what we believed R* learned from GTAO\, but it ended up being a disappointment. It sure is super fun to wander around in the first hours (especially if you don’t know the map yet)\, doing the few story missions and completing some activities (all updates included)\, but after that\, there is nothing really more to do. For the purists\, that might even have still been fine\, but then comes the worst: RDO servers. The trashest\, most unstable ever made servers. How many times did I get disconnected once\, twice\, 5 times\, 10 times in a single day? Way too many. Even GTAO which is far from being the perfect student on this\, works way better. It is irritating at a point where you want to pray in order not to get any disconnection. I know this issue doesn’t just happen to me\, but to a very high fraction of players.This is why my rating has to be balanced with a player’s priorities. Someone who doesn’t care about RDO at all will probably find arguments to justify a 10/10 rating. But if you are one of those who had high hopes for RDO\, then you might think a 7 or 8 would be more justified. I am part of those who love both solo and online. I can’t see myself giving anything less than 9 to such a solo masterpiece\, but I cannot give a 10 due to frankly disappointing online features. I hope R* or any other dev studio will be able to create such magnificent games in the future. But without overlooking the online components\, it’s even better!… Expand",True,0.05799546,0.004749298,0.013546381,0.018774498,0.043165036,0.018192071

And don't get me wrong\, these are big parts of a game...but the bad\, too\, is...significant.The gameplay feels like two different teams struggled against each other to unifySo\, I got over halfway through the game. Normally\, these sorts of games are right up my alley. Huge\, yet detailed and full of things to do. A great story. Customization. That's about where the \""good\"" ends for me. And don't get me wrong\, these are big parts of a game...but the bad\, too\, is...significant.The gameplay feels like two different teams struggled against each other to unify into one vision. On one hand\, you have the ultra-realism. They create a huge world that seems to be alive and breathe. It's obvious you're meant to feel immersed\, to really care about the characters\, story\, locations\, and so on. And then a minute later you're sprinting around on a mission\, forced to gun down 30 cops like you're playing GTA. Do you want to make a hyper-realistic game\, or an arcade shooter? Pick one or the other because the inclusion of one kneecaps the other.They often took the realism way too far\, and the gunplay not far enough. People don't want to sit around watching Arthur slowly pull cans out of a cupboard for the 451st time. A simple skip button after the tutorial would have fixed this. People don't need to sit there dumbly mashing a button for five minutes as you attempt to ride your way back to town from a mission. Again\, a simple \""automatically ride to x\"" option would have fixed this. Nobody wants to sit there blankly staring at the screen mashing a single button. How was that supposed to be fun? It wasn't\, but it's done in the name of realism. And there's where the gunplay is supposed to come in. This is the intended \""fun\"" part of the game. And yet it feels so boring and hollow. You go into cover\, pop up\, enemies can't aim but if they hit you\, it does nothing\, anyway. You gun them all down paying half-attention\, a cutscene plays\, and now you have to ride back to camp for the next five minutes. Again. And again. And again. The good writing attempts to salvage this\, but the formula being the exact same thing gameplay-wise for just about every mission overwhelms the save attempt for me.Outside of these criticisms\, a final one may be in that\, several months after release\, some of the game's mechanics still barely work and seemingly have been abandoned to cash in on Red Dead Online's microtransactions. The masks only work half the time\, and if they don't\, it can easily be some guy you've never seen before recognizing you...somehow. Want to get off a train? After watching the overly long cutscene\, you'll have a guard throw a fit at you for being on the train. Despite just using said train and trying to now get off. Like Poker? Don't play in Saint Denis - something went wrong there and a certain character constantly destroys everyone else at the table for whatever reason (Google it). Sometimes your horse avoids trees while running. Other times it pushes you directly into one.In many ways\, Red Dead Redemption 2 feels like an amazing game in concept\, that is heavily damaged by its extremely outdated gameplay and obsession with a system of realism that it\, by itself\, sabotages. Trading fun for that realism was a gamble\, and it looks like it worked out for them\, but in my opinion it probably shouldn't have. I can see an argument for a 8 (Any higher is overboard\, honestly) depending on the player\, but for me...6.5 rounded up to a 7.… Expand",True,0.112436704,0.005264282,0.025002124,0.03489272,0.09260304,0.013476364

Horse controls were pretty good\, but a few times my horse seemed to trip over something that wasn't there. Also\, never have your horse follow a moving train\, it will inevitably run in front of it at some point.Bad: The wanted system needs lots of work and is the main reason I don't think it deserves over a 9. It can seem random sometimes whether someone is able to identify you\, even with a mask and different outfit. Robbing a train is almost impossible. Even if you leave no witnesses and are in the middle of nowhere\, the law somehow manages to show up. Also\, NPCs will on occasion start fights with you\, even if you weren't being aggressive.

Game didn't crash once and I had no technical issues whatsoever. Should have won game of the year in 2018\, and is the best of the decade. My favorite game\, and the definition of the open world genre.DIFFICULTY: NormalThe difficulty is fair\, you need general knowledge on shooting but overall the tutorial teaches the mechanics and features pretty well\, though the tutorial is basically the first short chapter.GRAPHICS: 10/10\, MasterpieceThis is the greatest graphics in a game I will go as far as saying\, especially on PC. Whenever you are walking around to a mission\, from a mission\, to a point of interest\, or just wandering around (which I do reccomend) you will be stunned and never be let down in the setting and environment. Makes it a blast to do 100% completion\, which is basically just wandering around.STORY: 9/10\, Epic StoryOne thing Rockstar is criticized about (not heavily\, but it is brought up) is their inability to make a second half of a game. GTA V was critized for the second half where they added a bunch of new characters and unnessecary plot points\, and I have to admit RDR2 does the same thing. Don't let that stop you though! This time\, it's not as bad as GTA V (where I didn't have much of a problem anyway)\, but if I did have a problem with that\, I would put it at 8/10.SOUND/MUSIC: 10/10\, I am cryingIf Rockstar failed on the music\, this game would have no depth\, and loose a lot of why it is a Masterpiece today. Everytime the soundtrack kicks in\, I just get a feeling\, a feeling that makes me feel so good and truly immerses me. Every time it plays\, I feel like I am sucked into my monitor and become Arthur Morgan. Most of the parts I can't say due to spoilers (I want to make sure many people see this and buy the game)\, but oh my god the music is so great\, one of the best reasons why this is my favorite game of all time.LENGTH: 40-300 Hours\, its up to youAt about 170 hours I finished my first playthrough and that was doing most of the stranger missions\, entire story\, exploring\, and much\, much more. If you are a type of person who plays story mission after story mission\, compeltely ignoring the thousands of other things to do in this world\, (which I heavily do not reccomend at all)\, then it will take 30-50 hours. But please\, explore just a bit and do some stranger missions\, or be like me and take your time\, about an hour in between each mission.PRICE: UnderpricedMost people will be mad at that\, but thats only because they don't want to pay more money. I believe it should be worth a little more due to the amount of things you can do in this world. But a company wouldn't do that due to basically all AAA games being 60 dollars.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:-Gameplay seemed hard at first\, but after a little bit I got used to it\, wasn't confusing to me at all after-Extremely detailed\, even places you go to for like an hour and arent even in the main map-There are a few times you make a desicion\, but I am completely fine with that as it shows that it is the story based it game it should beIn conclusion\, this does nothing close to dissapoint\, you will be stunned at the environment\, very immersed in the story and times the soundtrack plays\, which is extremely fitting\, spend a ton of time in the game (if you finish it\, which you should\, and overall be getting a once in a lifetime experience.… Expand",True,0.08479069,0.006866455,0.00899048,0.020772645,0.069969244,0.016810767

The epilogue also feels rather pointless and drags on for way too long for what little plot it has.Considering the scale of the game\, the attention to detail is quite impressive. While not on the level of Uncharted 4\, RDR2's scale makes it the greater achievement. When the game takes shortcuts in production\, however\, it becomes way more obvious than it would if the game took a more relaxed attitude towards presentation and immersion. For instance\, when you dismount a horse and your weapons magically \""attach\"" to you\, or when shoveling manure onto a wheelbarrow the \""product\"" moves as one stiff lump.Inconveniencing the player for the sake of \""immersion\"" is also not that great of an idea. Your horse magically teleporting to you at the end of many of the story mode missions is proof that\, at the end of the day\, the devs must've understood that the usual videogame approach of spawning your horse at a touch of a button is the preferable solution\, yet proceed to inconvenience the player all the other ways. The game\, at its core\, is the apex obsession with gameplay systems that just pad the game or add complexity for complexity's sake\, which has been escalating since as far back as GTA: San Andreas. In RDR2 there are systems such as hair growth\, changing body weight\, horse hygiene and the need for weather-appropriate clothing. All that pointless complexity also resulted in overly elaborate controls.The game also didn't know when to end on a high note.

Open world and story driven games are my favourite games so of course I'm going to love this. If you don't enjoy story games then you wont like this. Because - The story - AMAZING\, long and detailed. The acting - AMAZING (and i dont say that often\, i can pick up a **** actor on tv etc instantly and they often ruin it for me) The graphics AMAZING and even the movements and facial expressions of Arthur\, your horse and the other characters (even NPCs and wild animals too) are fantastic. The hunting system is great\, its difficult to kill some tiny animals with a bloody bow and arrow but it makes it fun\, so if you dont fancy doing some missions for a bit you can go hunting or do some challenges. The cooking/crafting system was strange at first but it makes sense and is quite simple really and quite enjoyable.This game is so realistic. It can be a very hard learning curve at the start and to be honest i nearly gave up this game after the first hour it really got on my nerves\, specially when riding through towns and i kept knocking people over and getting bounties and witnesses to minor crimes (that was the most annoying bit throughout the game in all honesty) however i persevered and after a day or 2 i had learnt all the controls and nuances and I'm so glad I did.The missions are most of the time\, different\, and unexpected things happen in them. They can also be really long. The last few took me a week to complete\, in fact I've been playing this game for the last 7 months\, pretty much every other day with maybe the odd week break and that is how long its taken me to complete it - ive not got 100% im at 86.5 or something but ive done all the stranger and side missions that i have found\, got all but the last legendary animal\, done around half the challenges and explored the total map.Storywise - Arthur has been the best character I have seen in any video game. Theres so many funny lines that he says throughout the game aswell - he is a sarcastic lovable character. I think the most fun mission for me in this game is the one in the bar in Valentine with Lennie. After the game ended I had to watch this again.Yes it has some negatives\, i think overall its an easy game to beat and maybe some difficulty settings would have been better here. Also the wanted system is very annoying\, especially when committing train robberies - you have a bag over your head in a long underground train tunnel yet no lawmen are there and they somehow know its you before they even arrive. Nearly every time I have tried a train robbery my bounty was more than what I earned from it. This game is ABOUT a gang of criminals and the game makes it totally difficult to commit any crimes at all\, if not even trying to steer you away from doing that. I suppose it makes sense given the various endings though but still.As a female I would have liked MORE FEMALE LEAD characters having a bigger role. Yeh its set in the late 1700’s and yes women were left behind in that era however the game was made in 2018. I thought Sadie was a great character and would have loved a bit more of that. Not even many stranger missions or encounters were from females. Apart from the ones that always needed saving\, so Rockstar this would have been more ideal.Lack of fast travel for the most part of this game was quite annoying too - and made the game take so long. Only near the end of the game (i bought it 2nd hand) Rockstar introduced the fast travel (and photo mode which is fun too) it should have been in the game from the start. The auto equipping of weapons is annoying too. I would put some guns on my back ready for something\, id get off the horse because i would come across someone that needs saving\, id get there then i would have no guns on me! The game takes them off you for some reason if your still sat on your horse. Its similar for missions too and loads you up with random ones and not the ones you want. Another main annoyance is that half of the map is un-explorable until the main story ends and there is only one stranger mission that I have encountered here and I’ve ran around everywhere on this side of the map. Bit of a waste really and 3 legendary animals are on this side aswell which seems pointless as you can make trinkets out of them but don’t really have any use of them for many missions. A very minor thing that I would have liked is that Arthurs hair doesn't have a length limit! Why does it when everything else in the game is so detailed. even your horse has different hair lengths and colours to choose from lolIn conclusion\, Despite the negatives I'm really sad that I have finished the game now i wish it would carry on and on and on haha. Well done to Rockstar for this game\, PLEASE make your next one as good as this - storywise especially. Arthur will always have a special place in my heart hahaha… Expand",True,0.23415339,0.017997624,0.035331827,0.06634661,0.2761231,0.023199292

We see our companions\, who we robbed with\, or even got drunk with being replaced by people that we got no trust\, and that made me going to the camp the less I could.There are some different quests with fun mechanics\, that makes the gameplay be more varied. The customisable character is a cool addition. The mini games like poker and blackjack gives you some The Witcher 3 vibes.By the end\, this game made question something: was Dutch a bad person?

I'll start with the obvious.  Do you enjoy story driven cut-scene heavy games?  Because this game has a lot of this\, and it moves at its own pace.  This is not a fast game.  It's a beautiful huge game that rewards over weeks\, even months of play\, even after the single player story is done\, because there are hundreds of things to do to 100% it\, and there is the online game to move to.Graphics\, music\, acting\, animations\, cut-scenes all amazing.. blah blah\, everyone knows.  But is the game 'fun'?  For me\, finally\, yes.  But on the condition that you are fine with a slower pace.  There's limited fast travel early on so you'll be doing a lot of travelling.  If you're not a player that can face traversing on a horse through massive but beautiful landscapes early on then.. you probably won't even complete the first 3 or 4 chapters let alone story\, and miss out on so much.  It might be very boring to you.  For me\, it's a near-masterpiece. I say 'near'\, because it's got issues..After all this time\, I still don't like all the controls.  They're just janky at times.  You can't do some things very 'quickly'.  Want to change a weapon load out on the fly quickly?  Nope\, not very well.  Some of the animations can also become irritating after a while\, like skinning animals.  After the 000th time seeing it play the whole thing... and doing the hunting tasks for a Plat trophy too? holy... so lack of skippable things is a pain.  And the menu's.  There's probably 3 or 4 too many steps in some of the screens\, which can become a pain.  Also doing the platinum trophy itself is absolutely a chore for some of its elements\, be it the gambling challenges (Blackjack and Dominos are painful because based more around your 'luck' than anything you can control)\, hunting\, whatever\, and all the collectables.The plat trophy is immense\, but there's also a TON of things to do\, and it's a rewarding challenge to get it done.  Your girlfriend will respect you for the full 2 hours after you achieve it before she finally decides to leave you because you've spent 2 months on the game instead of her.Online.  I played the beta early on in Dec or Jan 2018\, and then kind of put it a way for a while.  It wasn't ready\, and then it became 'more' ready\, and as of today\, with its season passes and Moonshiner role\, it's really getting there.  I've sunk over 200 hours in\, and it's had issues: camp won't spawn\, not enough animals\, issues with $$ exploits\, XP won't arrive properly (bounty hunter role missions).  The fact is though\, for a new person coming to online\, a lot of this has been addressed by Rockstar and there's now a TON of stuff to do from its own story missions (bank robbery is a highlight)\, various stranger requests\, of course the PVP modes\, of which there are a ton if that's your thing and finally\, the 'roles' you can choose to level: bounty hunter\, collector\, trader now Moonshiner business.  Online is also faster\, with quicker animations\, reloading\, etc so it's zippier than single player now\, which it needs to be if you're expected to play with or against other human players.   And there's a ton of content even I've yet to play just added from the recently released PC port (which had its own issues).I was thinking a strong 8 owing to some of the issues\, but this will get a 9 for all its online content\, the 'world'\, all it's pro's: visuals\, acting\, story\, and I think they outweigh some of the issues: controls\, the repetitive grind on some of the Plat trophy stuff\, the repetitive animations (skinning animals)\, and the menu's that have too many steps.  For the low price this game currently retails\, for me its an essential purchase but given some of the conditions I said earlier.… Expand",True,0.056263726,0.0031471252,0.014350293,0.0233509,0.06145202,0.011456826

In theRed Dead Redemption 2 is the pinnacle of rock art and is one of the best open-world games in history. Stay tuned for more.Rockstar Games has always shown its art of surprising audiences; Whether it's with the first-ever GTA versions of a world-wide experience to offer that time\, or when with the three-dimensionalization of the series\, there was a new definition in this genre. In the previous version of Red Dead Redemption\, Rockstar proved that his art is not limited to making GTA\, and that he can have a lot to say in games with a different feel and mood. But aside from that\, this time it's Red Dead Redemption 2's turn. An experience that is not only the best rock star game to date\, but also one of the best games of the eighth generation. First of all\, we invite you to watch the video review of the game below to explain in detail about the game:All in all\, let me repeat the first thing I said about the game; Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just a game at all\, it's more like a virtual world\, but in its most realistic form\, we've seen it in a video game to date. Red Dead Redemption 2 has such a dynamic and engaging world that experiencing it like any other game just to complete missions and get to the end of its story\, makes it impossible for us to get the pleasure we need from the game. To enjoy Red Dead Redemption 2\, you have to literally live the world of your life as Arthur Morgan\, go on side missions\, don't forget to hunt and use the resources you need to upgrade\, and most importantly\, He sat down to talk with different characters and enjoyed their fascinating adventures and super-interesting character-making. Aside from that\, it's really easy to talk about graphics and things like the visual or audio effects of the game; Because in a nutshell\, Red Dead Redemption 2 has one of the best graphics among eighth-generation games\, and everything is in the best possible condition. Like any other element\, the music is in perfect harmony with the other elements and the ideal level\, and it helps a lot to immerse the player in the game as much as possible and makes the impact of the game's minutes more enjoyable. So in a word\, if your heart wants a work that is literally worth several times the $ 60 you pay for it\, don't miss the best Rockstar Games game ever made\, or Red Dead Redemption 2.This game has been reviewed on the PlayStation 4 platform.… Expand",True,0.04785245,0.0033569336,0.012541492,0.017227544,0.038154904,0.01508414

Super\, super long horse rides on a massive map spamming \""X\"" to make your horse sprint? Yup. Constantly having to swap weapons off your horse? Yup. Want to get missed trophies and so you have to replay the ENTIRE story AGAIN? Yup. And the list of annoyances just goes on and on and on.The positives are the new things that you get to experience\, like train robbing\, flying a hot air balloon\, wirelessly controlling a toy boat and shooting down other toy boats\, etc. The graphics are absolutely spectacular. While it makes the game take absolutely forever to load\, it's well worth being shrouded in fog riding through a dark\, scary swamp seeing the lighted lanterns dimmed by the thick fog that you can barely see 10 feet through. Or the water. The freaking WATER man!!! Just\, omg\, you've never seen water this pretty in a game until you see it in RDR2. The little things of seeing wagon wheel tracks in the dirt behind a wagon or seeing your footprints in the snow or mud. So nice. There are also different biomes in the world which is cool.Unfortunately\, the graphics and such don't make up for everything annoying and boring in this game. I'm only replaying the story just for the trophies and not because I want to\, unlike the previous RDR game.

My issues with this game are related to gameplay; the cover system is completely broken\, combine this with the clunky movement of the character and things can get really frustrating at times. Also\, the game never forces you to try new things out and punishes you for experimenting so you always end up using the same 3 weapons.

I want to get in JRPGs\, strategy\, etc but can't. Don't even try to get me started on Walking Sims. So it should say something how the slower life simulator aspects make the game immersive as hell. I have played basicay every AAA open world game\, but not a single one has ever created a world that feels so alive and dynamic (except maybe BOTW) while having one of the greatest character stories ever told in a video game. Let me explain:As good as many open world games are\, they often feel like giant hub worlds with mission starts and collectibles to get. Things can happen but it still feels like you're almost in a glorified level select with npcs. But in RDR2\, nothing feels like a checklist\, and there is just so much detail and Rockstar have found a way to implement it so fluidly you'll lose all your time to just exploring and living in it. Just getting on your horse and going to an area you haven't been is inherintly rewarding bc you never know what you find.It isn't an rpg so stats and upgrade items are really a thing\, what you'll find are unique and interesting landmarks or stories. You may come across the remains of a suicide cult\, a haunted house\, a lonely woman learning to brave the wilderness on her own after her husband died\, bumbling KKK idiots you can firebomb\, etc. All incredibly written\, voice acted\, or just told through the scenery and notes. And this goes for the entire game.

Yes it's still the same rockstar gun mechanics\, but I found it satisfying as all hell bc of the dead eye mechanic and the outstanding sound design that make the shootouts intense and visceral. And it also does have kind of a morality based mechanic effecting the narrative but done in a way that's entirely baked into the game and effecting by how you play vs a shallow pick and choose (the best I can compare it to is Silent Hill 2) that really ties what happens to the person you made Arthur to be. So I cried like a gosh darn baby at the end of my first playthrough bc you feel so attached to everything. YOU are Arthur Morgan\, the horse you choose is YOUR best friend\, and this is YOUR story.

The things that are bothering me about this game are things that are fundamental to the gameplay anyway\, and won't change no matter how much longer I play it.How to sum up RDR2: It's really not that much fun to play\, sadly. Considering I paid a fair sum for it\, and am a big RDR\, and was waiting ages in anticipation of this game's release\, then I ask myself why my PS4 is switched off and I'd rather surf the net instead? I should be glued to the game during any free hours that are available\, chomping at the bit to get back from work to get back into the fray \, but instead I'm kind of sighing like ok\, I'll give it another shot\, it's going to get better. The game feels like it's had a lot of love invested in it\, but it's unbalanced love\, focused too much on unnecessary details and a plethora of tedious tasks/chores and not enough on fun gameplay. You can still communicate an artistic and meticulously-crafted experience\, but the game still has to be fun!Obviously\, the users giving it 0/10 are clearly wrong\, there's no way it's a 0/10\, but\, at the same time\, the critics giving it 10/10 seem deluded? There's no way a game this flawed is a masterpiece/GOTY candidate. Absolutely no way near it. Horizon Zero Dawn was a 9/10 for me\, and it was a pleasure to play. You found yourself struggling to put the controller down. Not so in this case. Regarding the critics reviews of RDR2: is there something more sinister at play...?Pros:- When out and about in the open world\, the graphics are really nice\, the world feels very real and alive\, with weather changes\, wildlife\, nice scenery etc. The storms that come in look really beautiful.- There's clearly been an investment of time in covering details which make the towns look like real old west towns.- The option to kill/spare some side characters that you meet adds an element of Telltale to the game\, giving you the impression you're making your own story to some extent.Cons:- The control system really saps the fun out of the gameplay. It's convoluted\, confusing\, and very difficult to use\, especially during the times when you need to retrieve items fast from your inventory\, or switch guns. What were Rockstar thinking\, in making the control system this way??- The movements of Arthur Morgan are clunky and don't feel smooth. He's either sauntering at a snail's pace or running full out. No in between. The playable cut scenes restrict you in many ways\, but its' not always clear you're in one. It's frustrating. Gun fighting\, running from cover to cover is awkward and doesn't flow well. Fist fighting is mostly just mashing one button and requires very little skill. It's not fun. It's certainly no Batman Arkham.- It's too much hassle to commit any crimes. I defended myself against an O'Driscoll\, beat him up\, then the law was called on me. It wasn't clear what the sheriff wanted me to do? It seemed like he was telling me to 'go on\, git' (as in get out of here) but when I tried to run he started shooting. I then had to fight off a neverending spawn of deputies and run in my clunky run/swim style for about 15 minutes. The bounty system means its much. much more convenient to just pay off your bounties than continue to be an outlaw\, as your crimes never go away.- The graphics of close up faces aren't anything special for PS4. Detroit Become Human set the bar on graphics and RDR2 is nowhere even close.- There are just too many tasks/chores to remember! Brush your horse\, feed your horse\, shave your face\, clean your guns\, earn money for the camp\, hunt food for the camp\, wear the right warm/light clothing\, take this tonic\, eat this food\, and so on and so on. The tasks/chores actually do feel like chores\, and I want to play a video game\, not do chores.My advice would be if you are a RDR fan and want to give it a shot (no pun intended) then wait until the price goes down\, and maybe during that time the game will be patched a bit.Hopefully Rockstar will read some fan reviews and take note for their next endeavour\, as if RDR3 continues along this path\, I won't be buying it.

Maybe it's the fact that in video games your character can die 50 times along the way and still come back\, they can take 5 bullets to the chest and somehow still win the fight\, so the outcome of a story can be somewhat disjointed. But sometimes you can play a game\, and be totally immersed into that world\, and character that you can't put it down.Describing the world of Arthur Morgan can never do it justice\, its beautiful\, massive\, alive\, mysterious and full. it's a toy box of small and big stories and characters. it looks and feels like a window into the past\, down the tiniest details. Rockstar has always delivered rich and interesting worlds\, but this far exceeds anything they've done before.From the stunning graphics\, to the immersive sound\, to the believable\, if somewhat flawed characters\, none of which are saints\, but all of which are likable in their own right. everything just feels real and raw.At first\, I wasn't sold on the protagonist Arthur Morgan\, he seemed spiteful\, nasty and vindictive\, but you soon realize that underneath all that hard skin is a real person\, with a troubled past\, with friends and enemies\, with hopes and dreams\, and it makes you gradually care more and more about him as the game goes on. And you also develop a liking for Arthur's unruly band of scoundrels too.My favorite place in the game is the home camp. I often found myself spending hours sitting around the campfire\, listening to everyone's stories and songs\, interacting with everyone and always hearing something new. There seems to be a never ending supply of dialogue\, some of which you'll only hear at certain points of the games story. It feels like a typical dysfunctional family\, where everyone has their own quirks\, likes and dislikes\, some people don't get on\, but as a whole everyone enjoys each others company.The Gameplay is also top notch\, The gunplay\, the riding mechanics\, the cover system and the hand to hand combat all feel like they've been finely tuned and refined over and over again to near perfection.Visually this game is beyond beautiful\, the lighting\, realistic textures\, character models that change over time\, the mud\, water\, trees\, everything all just works together to create a believable open world.outside of the story is the multiplayer\, at the beginning this was very bare bones and not something that interested me much\, but this has been added to over time and has improved\, but the single player element is where this game shines. The story will grip you from start to finish\, it's hard to put down. I played this game for 18 straight hours one day\, and I have a short attention span usually so that speaks volumes.this game isn't perfect\, you'll probably encounter the odd bug here and there\, I fell through the map on a few occasions\, and some of the missions miss the mark\, but it's all forgivable as on a whole this game is amazing.

From what I've experienced so far:The game is for you if:- you like wildwest setting- you like single player story with good voice acting- you have a lot of time to do chores and menial tasks- you enjoy riding horse for 2-3 mins at a time to get from point A to point BThe game is not for you if:- you don't like wildwest setting (obviously)- you suck at precision shooting and prefer rapid fire shooting- you have job/other obligation and cant afford to spend 6 hours per day playing the game- you like continuous engaging gameplay instead of doing chores over and over againPros and ConsPros- Good voice acting- Decent open world size- A lot of details in customization\, you can change shirt\, boots\, hat\, coat\, even customizing your horse and weapons. While it does have some significance in GTA V\, I just don't see it here (like I want that cool spoiler on my car but couldn't care less if my horse has long hair or spiky hair). Some people might find this appealing though.Cons- Riding system is poorly designed to say the least. You need to keep your finger on the X button all the time and it's very tiring. You can autopilot it by engaging cinematic mode but still it's very slow progress where the horse would trot leisurely. You can't leave it either because you need to be aware of your situation such as having a bunch of guys trying to kill you midway- Poor riding systemm combined with almost non existent feasible fast travel. You can only do it by going to a coach station (this might not the correct term) and it only works when there is a coach there. The destination is very limited and for the in game economy the price is quite steep. I have about $200 left on my pocket while holding buying a rifle - a short range passage cost 4.5 and long range cost about double. Surely not something I can use very often. So hours on the horseback it is.- Grindy hunting system and the weight the game put on it. It tied on everything so far\, better gears\, skill upgrade\, special equipment\, and so on. This will takes a lot of your time and you will hate every second of it.a) animal you're looking for is marked by image on the map. You go there and they might/might not existb) you need perfect skin to get anything out of it and for it you need perfect animal\, perfect shot\, at a perfect spot. The game randomize the animal condition so you need to use your binocular from afar\, mark the perfect one if you find can it\, getting closer on your knees\, and hoping for a perfect shot. Missed the shot and they will scamper to god knows where.c) Useless tracking system. You can choose to track your target but when there are a lot of activities the you will also see other tracks and other animals highlighted. Not to mention the trails is difficult to see and gone within seconds.d) Seeing small animals is difficult\, let alone hunting them and landing perfect shot. They're always running between grasses and difficult to see.e) On top of that\, progression is tied to hunting. Want better gear? hunt. Want more deadeye skill? hunt. Want more of everything? hunt. It's basically designed that there is no way to skip it.Still have some motivation to continue but I don't know if it's enough to get me to finish the game. I only have 1-2 hours to play and most of the time I want real gameplay on those 2 hours\, not hiding behind bushes trying to headshoot a deer before my hand shaking for drawing bowstring 2 seconds too long.… Expand",True,0.11150667,0.0062942505,0.024600167,0.032028005,0.09775851,0.016638106

The music and sound effects are alsoLet’s get what this game gets right out of the way first:  the visuals.  This game defies belief... especially if playing on a proper HDR screen.  The attention to detail in the animation\, the weather effects and particularly the mud and snow effects are like nothing else in gaming.  Although it’s far from perfect... I’ll come back to this.  The music and sound effects are also incredible... just take the noise your horse’s hooves make on the various different surfaces.  A lot of effort went into that.  The surround sound placement is possibly the best I’ve seen in a PS4 game.Now the bad... the user interface and controls of this game are without doubt the most confusing and badly designed I’ve ever encountered... and bear in mind that I play (and have no problem with) Elite Dangerous on the PS4.  Let me give you just 3 examples (but there are loads more).Example 1:  To bring up the weapon/item wheel\, you hold L1\, then hold a direction with the right joystick\, then release L1 while still holding that direction.  The problem is that the right joystick moves the camera after exiting the weapon wheel\, which is irritating if what you were wanting to do was switch weapons.Example 2:  Selecting certain weapons involves holding L1 to bring up the wheel\, holding the right joystick in a direction to select a category\, then pressing L2 or R2 to cycle through those choices.Example 3:  Quick draw... you’re told to gently hold the R2 button until a meter rises to a certain level... except the meter is not very obvious.  I’ve not looked this up on the Internet yet\, but after 3 or 4 quick draws... I have no idea what meter they’re talking about\, but the screen also turns yellow\, so I wait for that to happen before fully depressing R2\, and then maybe spamming R2 a few more times.  And this seems to work!  But it’s very likely not what you’re supposed to do.  Each quick draw seems to have its own rules as to what a successful outcome should be.And these are just part of the “standard“ controls - you also get completely different ad hoc controls for things like changing a wheel on a wagon.  What it reminds me of most is those awful David Cage games.  It’s all horrendously confusing.  If you’re playing every day\, then you do eventually get used to it\, but if you stop playing this game for more than a week\, getting back into it is gruelling.Back to those visuals... good as they are\, they’re far from perfect.  The number of times your main character clips through objects (e.g. when sitting on a train or tram seat)... given the attention to detail elsewhere\, this feels sloppy.  First time I encountered the palaeontologist lady\, she was clipping through the scenery too... and the first time I visited the “fence” in Emerald Farm\, his entire shop counter was invisible\, save for a candlestick floating in the air in front of him.  And this is in July 2020... why have these things not been patched?  This is Elder Scrolls levels of bugs.Additionally\, for all the deep detail and complexity of the gameplay\, some of it makes no sense at all.   For example\, I encountered an escaped prisoner in chains by the side of the road\, so I did what I thought was the right thing and lassoed him\, stuck him on the back of my horse and took him to the nearest sheriff’s office.  But en route\, a passer-by accused me of kidnapping and within a minute\, I was a wanted man\, eventually being arrested and thrown in jail as I got to the sheriff’s office.As for the story/plot... that’s just the usual Rockstar fare\, recycled from a bunch of movies\, but as if copied by an onlooker who didn’t really understand what they were watching.So\, on the one hand\, you have this absurd attention to details that don’t really matter... and on the other you have areas (UI and gameplay consistency) that do matter neglected entirely.  When you consider the punishing hours the developers reported put into this... well it shows that “crunch“ merely delivers quantity rather than quality.What bewilders me still is the ludicrously high review scores the game got... but I put this down to craven sycophancy in the gaming press\, combined with a similar attitude to rushing out material to meet a deadline.… Expand",True,0.11336674,0.00667572,0.022188433,0.030154925,0.07676199,0.025098583

So let's just get to the summary.Summary:\n\nGameplay - [7] TheNow I'll start this review off by saying that this game is a fantastic game\, but it still has a lot of issues. The main issue with the game is definitely the controls and gameplay. But even with all of the issues I still love this game. The story and soundtrack are phenomenal and there are definitely more pros than cons. So let's just get to the summary.Summary:Gameplay - [7] The gameplay is very mixed for me. The biggest con of this game is the terrible controls. Shooting feels horrible and you pretty much have to use lock-on aim. Just doing anything feels bad because of the controls. The movement is extremely clunky and shouldn't be allowed in a finished game. Rockstar is known for using outdated gameplay mechanics but this is just so incredibly bad. At the same time beating someone up or shooting people is still very fun and they deserve a bit of credit for it.Story - [10] This game has one of the best game stories I have ever played. There really aren't any bad things about it. The game is essentially about the extinction of outlaws and how they are not wanted anymore. They have to flee from a place called Blackwater because of a heist gone wrong. But through all of this\, we have a particular man called Arthur Morgan who is the protagonist. During the game\, Arthur goes through a change and realizes he doesn't want to die a bad man. Throughout the game\, you can see that he is trying to change for the better and in my eyes\, he does succeed. And while changing he also has to stay in hiding with the gang.Graphics - [10] You all knew this was going to be a 10/10. The graphics are some of the best I have ever seen and the game deserves all the credit for it. The textures are fantastic and I could spend time sitting on my horse just looking at the environment.  The graphics also help the game feel extra atmospheric.Soundtrack - [10] The soundtrack is fantastic in this game. The soundtrack fits very well with the western-theme. It sounds like something you would find in an old western movie and that is awesome. Some of the songs stand out more than others\, but they are all top-class. I finished this game over half a year ago and I still listen to some of the songs from the soundtrack.In conclusion: The game is for the most part fantastic and a super good game. But Red Dead Redemption 2 also suffers from outdated gameplay mechanics and just the worst aiming in a game for a long time. Even though the game has some flaws it still didn't ruin the overall experience for me. In the end\, I still loved the experience and I'm left with only happy thoughts and I will remember this game for a very long time.… Expand",True,0.062236045,0.0041007996,0.018269362,0.0233509,0.059948977,0.014566151

However\, this game isn't perfect and is far from it. There are multiple bugs I've encountered\, weird animations\, bad pacing\, and bad mechanics. Despite all of this the good parts of this game outweigh the bad\, so let's get into this.Before I dissect this game\, let me lay down a few things. First\, I'm only going to be talking about the story and not about the online component of this game\, because that requires a whole other review. Second\, there are going to be spoilers\, so if you haven't played this game be aware. Third\, this review will probably miss a few things but keep in mind this is my first review\, so let's get started.To begin this review\, let's start on the world of Red Dead Redemption 2\, which is obviously the strongest part of this game. When you are just roaming the open world of Red Dead Redemption is when the game's at it's best. You are instantly immersed in the world and really feel like a gunslinger cowboy. The world is so in-depth with about 70 different species of animals all fully animated and given different interactions. As you ride around the world\, you will encounter random little side quests that require you to help people out or maybe the people trick you and try to rob you. The world is huge and even after you finish the campaign there's still so much to explore. On the service\, the world might seem very shallow because most of your time is just riding your horse around open plains\, tall mountains\, snowy forests\, and hot desert plains. But\, if you take a moment to look around\, you can see so much is there for you to witness and experience. All the NPC's have specific routes they follow during the day and night and all these specific actions that they take apart in. After using your gun's for a while you have to clean them so they function properly\, you need to maintain your health\, stamina\, and deadeye cores\, you gotta change your clothes so they fit the environment you're in\, and so much more. When all these things come together\, it feels amazing but it's very rare when all of these work so well. That's the main problem with this game\, all the components are so vast and complex but don't always function the way they are supposed too and the game's always flipping between letting you do everything by yourself to then holding your hand like a little child. This leads to the biggest problem with this game\, control.Control is something that every game strives for\, maybe the game wants to control you on what to do and when to do it\, which is perfectly fine in a game if they stick with it. Or\, maybe the game wants to have no control over the player\, which is also fine if the game sticks to it. However\, Red Dead Redemption 2 is constantly flipping between letting you do whatever you want and holding your hand like a baby. One moment the game is letting you explore every little thing the way you like\, you see a woman getting harassed\, you can either watch it or intervene and try to help the problem. You see an animal as you are riding your horse\, you have the option to hunt it or just let it live its life. Need some money\, you can go get an honest job\, or you can go rob a train to get money fast. That's all amazing but the game constantly\, as I said before\, is holding your hand. Which leads to the missions of Red Dead Redemption.Let's first start with the side missions of this game\, then we will get into the main missions. Most of the side missions feel so fun to do\, and at times feel like main missions. Most games have trouble making a gamer want to do the optional content but Red Dead Redemption's side mission's lure you in with its charm and just doesn't let go. Each side mission takes you into the life of all these NPC's and makes you want to learn more about all of their stories\, and the characters are another strong point of the game. However\, the main missions are a bit of a different story. Like I mentioned early\, the main missions constantly flop between linear and open and it just doesn't work as well as I want it too. Which is sad because I love a lot of the missions and the concepts they introduce but are just ruined by some of the choices Rockstar made.Now let's get into the final part of the review\, the characters/story. I love so many characters in this game\, all of them are so well crafted and have so much depth. However\, the only problem with this is there are too many characters for me to keep track of. These characters are still so good and I love every second that we got of them. Now the story\, the story is absolutely groundbreaking. I love so much how Arthur is conflicted with wanting to be good\, how he is good but knows he won't ever be due to the Gang. I love the ending of Arthur's story too\, as he starts to break apart from the gang and wants a better life for everyone.… Expand",True,0.11429678,0.0075149536,0.023193322,0.031807642,0.08775374,0.023026628

Only saving grace is the beautiful graphics\, but that doesn’t make up for a mess of a game.

THE OPEN WORLDBy far I haven’t seen an open world soo detailed\, soo full\, and soo beautiful as this one. Most games like this have large maps\, like AC odyssey for example\, but they’re just soo dull and empty. And rdr’s open world is just soo full. every single random encounter has a story behind them\, and there’s a total of 63...  and there’s soo many interesting inspectable locations that you can discover. You can find faces carved on trees\, a vampire. A war ground\, a mysterious tiny church\, and a METEORITE and soo much more. There’s about 51 of them\, each different and tell a story in their own ways. And this open world is just soo diverse\, you have deserts... grasslands\, forests\, swamps\, and snowy mountains... like really\, every place feels different. CUSTOMIZATION You can customize every single part of your beard\, whether it’s the moustache\, the sides\, or the chin. And you have the hair\, soo many different styles and lengths. And the clothes in this game are great\, I only wish you can open vests and add more coats\, black coats And just more clothes overall. STORYThe story of this game is great\, truly extraordinary. It sounds mediocre when you sum it up\, but it’s really not. Everyone complaining about the SloW PaCe should honestly go **** themselves\, rdr2 takes its time to build its character\, Arthur morgan specifically. Who’ll I’ll get into on his own. The story is perfectly paced\, and it  perfectly flows... every single chapter makes you feel different things. Chapter 1 makes you feel new and confused. Chapter 2 makes you feel happy and excited\, chapter 3 begins to make you feel the outlaw life chapter 4 makes you feel lost. Chapter 5 makes you feel destroyed\, and chapter 6 makes you feel\, depressed\, and dead. This is what art does people\, it makes you FEELGAMEPLAYA lot of people complain about the gameplay\, which makes me sad. It’s not terrible\, It’s immersive\, your hat can fall off\, you have to cook your own food\,  You can take a bath to look clean and smell good\, you can have realistically simulated scenarios. Yeah sure it can get clunky\, only if you run around in tight spaces. take the game slow\, walk around.  ARTHUR MORGAN He is THE best protagonist in any game\, and dare I say is one of the best fictional characters ever written. his actions and inactions throughout the game influences his choices and morality in the end of the game. Seeing Arthur slowly die of showed us a weaker side to the character\, but that side is what makes ANY protagonist great. His diagnosis scene shows a clear sense of vulnerability. The tuberculosis is what kick started his change morally\, although he still would’ve tried to save John and the rest of the good guys\, the illness is what influenced him to dedicate all the time he has left into what he is trying to achieve\, Arthur sees himself in John\, he sees what he could’ve achieved\, an opportunity to find love and live peacefully. And that’s why he wanted to help John\, but John isn’t the only person. Misses downes\, the wife of the man that gave Arthur TB and the man that Arthur beat up\, he beat up a sick dying man. A man that has only done good in this world. He decides near the end to help her\, and what I love about his story is the symbolism\, the man who picks up Arthur and sends him to the hospital when he blacked out looks a lot like Thomas downes\, this symbolizes how Thomas\, in a way helped Arthur get his redemption\, by giving him The illness that influenced his change in MorallyEDIT: I decided to continue this review\, seeing how the reviews that are lower than 6 piss me off because of how wrong they are. Everyone who complains about this game either doesn’t understand the mechanics or just sucks at it. This game is meant to be taken slow\, I remember going back to camp at 11 Pm seeing the gang members sleep and I too til morning... and seeing them wake up And I having to go grab a cup of coffee and sit by the campfire with Javier\, and coming back at night to see Pearson\, or Javier\, or Hosea or anyone telling a story about their past. Is just  soo immersive. Yes the game has flaws\, but does it? Gunplay is okay if you tweak it in the settings... is it amazing? No. Is it terrible? Definitely NOT. it’s fine. The only flaw this game has (for me) is that it could be much better. I don’t know if rockstar just didn’t think of it or didn’t have enough time but I could think about 40 ideas to improve the game’s mechanics and elements\, which are already good The only have nitpicks that could get irritating once in a while. for example\, the weight system. I hate how quickly you could become skinny or fat in the game. It can get annoying to maintain “average” weight let alone “perfect” another is how john’s hair in the epilogue is Arthur’s hair dyed black. Which is pretty stupid.… Expand",True,0.23451406,0.016190045,0.021786476,0.057890166,0.16869035,0.017674083

Total immersion: the scenery is magnificent\, the story is enthralling\, even the side missions and the bounty quests are very unique and enjoyable. Heck even the travelling from place to place (i was pretty sceptical when i heard that there was no fast travel in rdr2) lends itself to the world and immerses you into it completely.2. The Characters: each and every character feels like a real person. Dutch\, Sadie\, Pearson\, Micah\, hamish\, charlotter\, just to name a few. There is an amazing texture to the world around you because of these characters.3. Morally ambiguous protagonist: agreed that there have been many games in the past few years boasting of the same\, but Arthur Morgan and his characterization has been spot on.Negatives:1. Maybe the controls as mentioned in many negative reviews.2. Addictive: the immersion leads to addiction; i was not able to take my mind of it even at work. very few games have this effect.

Overall everyone is better than the first game and dialogue is A-level fantastic.The story - this is the best story in any game ever. Put both RDR games together and its one the greatest stories ever told in any medium. This game will make the first one have more of an impact if you decide to play it again.- The graphics - the first red dead had the best lighting in its time. This one steps the bar up way high. The environment is stunning. You can ride around doing nothing but sight seeing its so damn pretty. I could play this in VR but something about the awkward movement controls tells me it would be a headache.The Bad- Horse riding mechanics. You will hit trees. You will run into other people blocking the road. You will fall off cliffs because they don't always want to go straight. If thats not bad enough\, the map is gargantuan and holding the joystick forward tapping the button gets really old. Horse riding is a chore.- You'll shoot someone in the face trying to talk to them because the aim your weapon button and talk button are the same. Genius right?- Frame rate dips in cities - it runs smooth when you get out in the open but go to a town\, especially Saint Dennie and you'll be stuck in a slide show (minus 20 frames). Just bring this masterpiece to PC already. My computer can maximize the potential of this game.- Movement controls - its too floaty and doing simple things like picking stuff up or looting is a pain in the a**. The character's movement is fluid and realistic but its not fun. This is a video game after all.The Ugly- BOUNTIES!!! It is no fun committing crimes in this game. If you travel to a city for a mission and accidentally hit someone with your horse or some other small crime\, they chase you out of town and the mission is locked and you have to come back later. Its extremely annoying. You can't even breath on someone without getting a bounty.  If you commit a crime and there is a witness\, regardless of whether you wear a mask or not\, a complete stranger can identify you even in the wilderness where no lawmen are around. Its really stupid and frustrating. You'll rack up some bounties. Its impossible to behave in this game. I've gotten bounties just for defending myself.Overall one of the most memorable games I have ever played. I already want to play it again. Hopefully they will remaster RDR 1 and put it into this game to make it the most complete package ever. I havent' done online yet but I easily got over 100 hours of single player doing side missions and easter eggs. I still give game of the year to God of War because everything was flawless. This game is amazing but because of the gameplay issues and bugs (which i didn't mention)\, it isn't a perfect 10.… Expand",True,,,,,,

The open world is huge and beautiful\, but also rather empty. You're basically on your slow horse a LOT to go from place to place\, getting bored in between. God how I wish there was a fast travel feature like in Assassins Creed.The very first time I set foot in the open world I accidentally ran into someone in the streets in Valentine (due to bad controls)\, who promptly attacked me. I hit him back and was immediately wanted by the police. That just didn't feel very good.Every time I get off my horse I have lost my rifles and bow. What the hell? How does that add any fun to the gameplay? Having to brush my horse\, clean my guns\, chop some wood\, do more chores.. again: how is that fun? Having to loot each and every dead body one by one (taking a good 4 or so seconds each)\, or opening every drawer in a closet one by one.. yes it's realistic but really who has the time for this in a game?The shootouts are kinda fun\, I am not too bothered by the aim assists\, but compared to other games.. it's just not good enough.

I see people saying how anyone who likes this game is dumb or delusional or whatever other troll comment possible and that is a demonstration of pure ignorance and stupidity. Not every game is made for YOU. Get that through your heads lol. Some people praise PUBG as being some kind of god-sent video game for the ages\, yet I find it to be mindless\, repetitive and un-rewarding... Just like every battle royale ever basically. But that doesn't mean that people who like it are stupid. Thinking that IS. Different people enjoy different things. End of discussion. Brats. That isn't to say that this game is perfect... no game is. like... ever. But it's perfect for some\, which is something that I think needs to be respected and understood. There's really no reason to insult people who like something you don't. Let's face it this isn't exactly what you would call some kind of objectively bad game. It certainly isn't for everyone\, but it also isn't the worst game ever made like some people have been commenting. That's just brainless hyperbole\, aaaaaaand some kind of strange level of entitlement that you only seem to see in gaming communities. ''It's not my type of game\, therefore it's a piece of crap''. SO stupid lol.Some people (myself included) really enjoy the slower paced ''realistic'' feel of the game. It works to make the game deeply immersive as you feel grounded in the game world. Speaking of game world. well.. The game world. Holy smokes\, man. No other game has created something this immaculately well designed and interesting. The only thing that comes close is The Witcher 3. Tons of mysteries\, Easter eggs\, quests\, interesting locations\, bizarre characters and random events. One thing it does do better is making the world feel genuinely alive. Insane amounts of dialogue have been put into the game which leads to tons of different contextual conversations\, comments\, fights\, insults\, and much more. It rarely feels like you've heard something twice out of a particular NPC's mouth or even between different characters which is amazing. The fact that you can listen in on long-winded conversations without it feeling forced is great. Sometimes listening in can even give you hints towards some secret treasures\, side-quests and other things of that nature. This gives you this cool feeling of ''If I hadn't listened I would have possibly completely missed that''. Maybe it'll be cash\, maybe it'll be a side-quest where you hunt down a serial killer of even a vampire in one of the main cities! Overall good stuff. In terms of visuals I don't think there's much I can say that hasn't already been said\, even by haters of the game. It looks ridiculously good\, ESPECIALLY for a console game (I'm running on a PS4 Pro). It'll be interesting to see how it will look on a gangster PC rig once it releases there. 'Nuff said lol.In terms of gameplay\, a few things need to be said. The third person controls can feel particularly weighty and sluggish at times\, no argument from me there! I've recently restarted the game and decided to play in First-Person this time around. This is a much better way to play for those who don't enjoy the weighty feel of the original camera. I've managed to tune the settings to make it feel like an actual FPS. Turned off auto-aim\, adjusted deadzones\, aim acceleration\, stick sensitivity\, and in all honesty it does wonders to make the game feel more fast-paced in the shooting sections. It also allows you to do things like strafing while shooting. You can also change the control scheme to ''standard FPS'' so things like sprinting are no longer relagated to tapping X until your thumb goes numb\, you just click R3 like you would with any other shooter. It even feels like Arthur walks at a faster pace because in first-person you either jog or sprint. If you want to walk you just input slightly on the joystick. MUCH better feel than having to hold down X to jog and tap incessantly to sprint. I also recommend making the cover system automatically switch to third-person and I also do that for horse riding. Only on-foot is standard FPS feel because shooting from cover or horseback in first-person isn't ideal I find. But again\, different strokes for different folks.I\, myself\, also really enjoy the story. The voice acting\, the facial animations and the situations your band of bums go through feel legitimate. It'S not perfect but in all honesty I find most games fall flat with their storytelling. Not this one (in my opinion). Motives are clear\, well explained and acted. This isn't mentioning the variety of side stories and mini self-contained stories you cna stumble across during your travels.In conclusion\, RDR2 isn't a perfect game by any stretch but it comes closer than most games ever have in my personal opinion.… Expand",True,0.51980776,0.05473421,0.10221587,0.4710501,0.36230123,0.060443077
77516,RDR2,2019-03-11,8.0,"Red Dead Redemption 2 was one of the few games I picked up on release day last year\, and it took me around five months and that was because at first I was enjoying my time with the game but that slowly changed I found elements to be tedious and monotonous\, by the time I got to the prologue I just wasn't as interested in seeing the story play out and so it became a game where I would playRed Dead Redemption 2 was one of the few games I picked up on release day last year\, and it took me around five months and that was because at first I was enjoying my time with the game but that slowly changed I found elements to be tedious and monotonous\, by the time I got to the prologue I just wasn't as interested in seeing the story play out and so it became a game where I would play if I had nothing else I wanted to play as I just wasn't enjoying the overly realistic approach to the game as it made it far harder to have simple dumb fun.Let’s break it down\, the game's story is possibly one of Rockstar’s best and while I didn't find it as interesting as GTA 5's story I did find myself enjoying two thirds of the story as I said I drifted away in the prologue as it felt like it was added purely put smiles on the faces of Red Dead Redemption diehard fans it was small quest all about how such a small insignificant part of the character's journey I personally don't feel like it needed to know the majority of the prologue it could've been kept ambiguous and I wouldn't have a complaint. But it was that portion that let down the entire game for me as I just stopped caring and lead to me not reminiscing about the experience from the first two thirds the parts I actually enjoyed and at points loved.How realistic is too realistic? That is a question I asked myself towards the end of the game\, I've always enjoyed free roam games because it's usually a game I can pick up and play and just have some dumb fun for an hour with Red Dead I found myself getting bored at the constant stocking up your health\, stamina and dead eye with consumables\, you also had to clean your weapons to ensure it fired with the best damage\, and if you want to try out a wacky hair style have fun waiting for it to grow as the magic barbers don't exist. And while I see that someone will enjoy these features I just didn't care for it by the end I would've preferred an option to turn it off and just allow regen so I can just mess around in this huge open world without thinking well I can't start a shootout because I haven't got many cigars meaning I'm not allowed to use deadeye\, it just slowed down the game to a pace that made it tedious and boring.Read Dead Online\, how could it fail? GTA 5 is overall an enjoyable experience with so much content and ways to play and the original Read Dead's multiplayer was incredible I put as many hours into that as I did with the single player and I just didn't find it enjoyable\, it has so many features from the single player causing the same issues and it forces the story down your throat trying it's best to assure you play through it to a point where I just stopped caring and stopped playing and from what I can tell it's failed nowhere near as many people play is as what was expected.Now even if I’m mostly negative in the review you must understand this game still has so many elements that are incredible it’s going to go down as one of the best games for several reasons and I’m pretty sure you can just look at any other review and you’ll find all those reasons so I don’t feel the need to go into detail here but just understand I would still say this is a good game just not the best game for me.I think this game could've been amazing game\, but it's just not an amazing Red Dead Redemption game\, it has elements that would work in a DayZ or Arma setting with the large open world with realism elements the multiplayer could've had so many elements that would lead to huge roleplay servers but with Rockstar running all the servers that won't happen for now. I hope we see a Red Dead Undead Nightmare 2 as I think many of these elements will work better in that compared to a traditional Red Dead.… Expand",True,0.11078331,0.008277893,0.024600167,0.025542418,0.08452088,0.033386398

Something that makes a decent ammount of money.I played the game again the last couple of days\, and there is just nothing to do after the story. You can`t just start a fight with someone or provoke someone to fight you\, because you will be the guilty. You can do stranger missions\, but they are really boring aswell.

When I was introduced to the protagonist Arthur Morgan\, I honestly found him a little off putting as he's very rough on the surface.  However\, after spending dozens of hours with him you see how wonderfully complex of a character he is.  By the end of the game Arthur Morgan was solidified as one of my favorite protagonists in video game history.  The story has some lulls as is common with open world games but overall I was very satisfied and left wanting to replay it immediately.Gameplay:  While the story and characters of RDR2 are phenomenal it's the gameplay that kept me coming back until I had logged over 200 hours in this game.  I joked with a friend that asked me what RDR2 is that it is a \""Wild West simulator\"" but it's really not far from the truth.  The shooting mechanics work very well and the horse riding is the smoothest and most detailed of any game I have ever played.  The clothing customization and grooming options are almost unlimited.  The \""survival\"" mechanics of eating/sleeping are simple yet add quite a bit to the game in terms of immersion.Setting:  The open world Rockstar Games created for RDR2 is very large and diverse.  From snowy mountains\, to open plains\, swamps\, forested hills and a fairly large city\, you will never get sick of seeing the same landscape and structures over & over as you traverse the map.  My only slight complaint on the map is that the mountainous regions are a little too underpopulated.  I often find myself in awe at the scenery and just riding around to admire the views.Conclusion: Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece in all facets.  This game can be played for 200 hours and you will still find new things in the open world and find locations that make your jaw drop because of the sheer beauty.  The gameplay is well polished and the story is engaging.

I was looking forward to spending endless hours and hours on it and was blinded by the hype.BUT sadly\, it's not worth my precious time and money.Here's why: Rockstar screwed up the gameplay. It's so BORING. This game should be called Red Dead Slow Motion.Gameplay/Controls:Everything Arthur is doing\, it's done so slowly. Walking like a turtle\, looting is a never-ending nightmare (you need to search every corpse in the same stupid way: kneeling down\, groping the body\, standing up again)\, aiming with your rifle is like lifting weights.Controls are too complex and clunky\, not intuitive at all. You often fight more against your controller than the enemies. Remember fighting with Aloy against a Thunderjaw? Or mashing Sigrun with Kratos? Do you feel the flow? That's perfect gameplay which you are not going to find here.Instead\, in the very first chapter you will be riding bloody slowly behind some retards for hours and just pressing one button. Feels like horse simulator redux.Graphics:The landscape is very beautiful and populated with wildlife. It's true eye candy. BUT the faces\, oh boy\, look at the faces. It's not '18 standard\, it's last gen. The facial expression seems like the only thing where the devs didn't care about realism. And they did include shrinking horse balls!!Story:I'm honest. I didn't make it very far. I quitted in the 2nd chapter. I was hoping for a story hook like in The Last of Us (similar case: mediocre gameplay\, amaaazing story) but I was disappointed.The story starts with a boring prolonged tutorial containing riding\, **** small talk\, a little bit shooting\, riding and more gossip. Your pals are so dull you can't even remember their names and they talk and talk and talk and can't stop talking.Conclusion:This game is JUST OVERHYPED. It's a real life simulation where doing tasks feel like a chore. Boring\, uninspired\, clunky\, slow-mo gameplay. Completely off the subject: Instead of focusing upon a fluid and interesting gameplay they wasted everything for endless\, negligible\, synchronized dialogues.

While I think this game is incredible\, it's not perfect and to be honest it has a lot to learn from another game developer\, Bethesda. There are many aspects from Fallout 4 I would love to see in a future Rockstar release.1: There's no fastThis is my first game review. I haven't even finished the main story of RDR2\, not most of the side quests\, but wanted to get my thoughts out there. While I think this game is incredible\, it's not perfect and to be honest it has a lot to learn from another game developer\, Bethesda. There are many aspects from Fallout 4 I would love to see in a future Rockstar release.1: There's no fast travel. I have spent way to much IRL time galloping across the map to get to quests. It's gotten so annoying that I am hard focusing on the main quest\, ignoring the side quest right now. I prefer Fallout 4's method where you have to discover every new place once\, but afterwards there is a decent fast travel system implemented.2: While RDR2 technically has a first person shooter mode\, it is not good. Funny enough Fallout 4's first person shooting is more conventional\, and more to my liking\, but Fallout 4's 3rd person is unplayable. I would like an open world game where I can switch between Rockstar's 3rd person and\, any competent first person shooter.3: Fallout 4 has a faster body looting system. I don't like it when Arthur takes forever to loot all the bodies he kills. Also Fallout 4 lets me steal clothing\, why can't I do this in RDR2? Some of the enemies have cool looking clothing\, but I can only steal their hat?4: I prefer the settlement building of Fallout 4 to the pre built camps from RDR2. In Fallout 4 I got to help customize my crib\, I can't give the campsites any real character or arrange them. I'm not saying RDR2 needs to have physics breaking moments like Fallout 4\, but I would like the ability to customize my crash pad.5: Fallout 4 and RDR2 have weapon management issues\, but I slightly lean in the direction of Fallout 4. This is because Fallout 4 allows me to carry LOTS of unique weapons\, meanwhile in RDR2 I get the sense that weapon carrying is more limited. While I love the weapon wheel from RDR2\, and the multiple ammo types\, I do wish RDR2 had a little bit better weapon variety. I understand the game is set in a realistic setting\, but I can dream I guess.6: V.A.T.S has a more user friendly activation. While overall I prefer Dead Eye\, I would like to press a button to activate Dead Eye and for it to be easier to use such as V.A.T.S. You can re balance Dead Eye\, but I don't use it very much because I don't find it too easy to use.7: Fallout 4 has a drug crafting system which is more interesting and\, for me\, easier to use/figure out if it exists. I love Jet and Psycho in Fallout 4\, I wish there was a counterpart in RDR2.8: Fallout 4 does not hide any weapons behind progression in the main story line. I haven't finished RDR2 story\, I can't get access to the repeating shotgun. I want to buy it so bad\, but for \""reasons\"" I can't get it.9: Fallout 4 allows you to bring a cute dog with you into combat. After doing this\, I am going to want to bring a dog with me in all open world games.Bonus issues I would like to vent about:Why does this game keep putting my damn weapons in my horse? I should have restarted a few missions after realizing my weapons didn't come with me after I get off my horse.These are my thoughts.

I'm around 80% through the story.ProsGraphicsdetailsoverall productionstory (both pro and con)ConsSLOW - some lengthy missions are simply cut scenes which annoyingly make you push a button once every 10 minutes to make sure you're awake.  Looting and skinning are also SLOW!  When given the option of realism or 10 minutes of my life\, I'll take the 10 minutes.Story - A clif notes version of the story of 5 or 10 minutes would have been great.  I haven't played RDR 1 in 10 damn years!  I'm supposed to remember the RDR 1 story line crystal clear?  This isn't a 2 hour movie we can re-watch\, it's a 100 hour game.  Some clue in the story to refresh my memory would have been great and I think I would have enjoyed the story 1000% more if I remembered more than the basics of RDR1.Gameplay - No less than 4 times\, I have wasted precious time in my life because of poor programming.  How do you think to put in the most minute details in the game\, yet fail on missions.  After a mission\, you want to loot bodies.  As mentioned before\, it takes a lot of time.  Suddenly\, without warning\, you will be looting your corpses and suddenly your half hour of looting is lost and the mission resets for \""abandoning the mission\"" or whatever **** reason they want to give you.  If you don't want me to loot in a mission\, then don't let me loot in a mission or at the very least\, let us know when we are in danger of losing all progress.  This is something even a bad game 20 years ago would offer.Controls - Overly complicated and frustrating.Fun - In GTA\, you can just go wild and be a criminal or you can try to be a slightly better person.  It's all good.  Here\, you have to choose one or the other.  If I'm trying to be good\, maybe I want to be bad for an hour and steal a train and shoot up a town.  You can do that.  It will cost you hundreds of in-game $$$ but you can do it.  I get the feeling I am missing out on so much entertainment due to the ridiculous bounties.  This is possibly the worst part of the game\, especially early on where a simple accidental horse vs horse collision suddenly gets you murder charges and a $50 dollar bounty (increases significantly with each one you kill).  This game seems to want to punish you for enjoying the very best aspects of it.  Why would Rock Star want to do such a thing?Conclusion - It's obvious that they put a LOT of effort into this game.  I think a year long beta would have helped this tremendously.  The end result is the best looking game of all time\, with just OK gameplay.  I hope you like overly long cut-scenes regarding a story line you will barely be able to remember from 10 years ago.5/5 and they're lucky to get that.… Expand",True,0.15324512,0.007095337,0.025203101,0.04910661,0.10116278,0.013113883

Some\, however\, will find many of the mechanics to be arduous and ultimately unrewarding. I’m somewhere in the middle. I love the aesthetic and the setting rules.

Wealth is extremely easy to come by (there are a plethora of locations where there are gold bars\, $500\, simply sitting there for you to take). Train robberies ARE rewarding if done right. Having a bounty on your head isn’t a pain\, bounty hunters are easy enough to kill. The combat with free aim on is very satisfying (although switching between weapons could be smoother and quicker). The world isn’t “empty” at all and the expectation that it would be any different in this sense (more populated) is a little surreal: this isn’t some steampunk recreation of the West with sprawling municipalities\, it’s mostly rural and reflects the kind of primitive capitalism of the time.

Not Mass Effect\, not Shadow Of The Colossus\, not Breath Of The Wild\, and certainly not Red Dead Redemption 2.I feel the need to clarify this point because of the absolutely absurd amount of 100/100 this game received (and a 105/100 from JeuxActu\, seriously guys?)\, in case you expect that to reflect reality.No\, it doesn't. And thank God for it. A perfect game shouldn't be sold\, it should be gifted to every living soul to be appreciated.Anyway. Onto the review's subject.RDR2 is a good\, but flawed game. And its flaws take root in fundamental aspects that Rockstar definitely needs to look into because this is an out-of-fashion way to make games: with an identity crisis.Want to roam the gigantic world? Feel free to\, but beware of the people who'll attack you\, and don't defend yourself in front of policemen or you'll get a bounty. Wanna shoot that horse's leg to prevent your enemy from fleeing? Too bad\, we had planned for you to use that horse to escape\, try something else. Do you like that revolver? Here\, play this mission with a shotgun then.For the most part\, RDR2 doesn't know how to approach player freedom without either making it seem stupid or completely pointless. And that shouldn't be one of an open world game's most glaring issues.For a more practical listing:Pros:-The software's world is beautiful. Like eye-piercingly beautiful. Every corner has been carefully crafted\, every single detail masterfully implemented. Be it the untamed wilderness or the busy city center of Saint-Denis\, everything feels real. Technically and artistically\, it's a masterpiece. Rockstar\, I salute you.-The writing is good. The ending takes the cake as the best VG ending of late 2018. A good portion of the main missions and all side quests are cool. The characters are cool\, they have motivation\, distinct personalities\, they feel tangible\, and spurt out great lines from time to time. And especially...-Arthur Morgan. Best Rockstar protagonist. Actually feels like a human being\, struggles and evolves\, unlike GTA V's overly stereotyped fellas (not a complaint\, they're written to be like that and I'm fine with it).-The music has its ups and downs\, but it mostly shines at the right moments. Shout out to the ending (again).Cons:-What I explained earlier. You mostly watch the game happen instead of playing it. As an example\, forcing the player to walk at a certain pace and in a certain direction doesn't feel rewarding.-Gunplay is basically auto-aim-lift-the-cursor-headshot. Come on now.-Controlling Arthur is hard. By hard\, I mean that he either handles like a freaking semi or spins around like a top. Also\, by preaching ultra-realism\, some minor activities become actual chores. I needed to dedicate an entire hour every few couple of them for baths\, food and whatnot\, because it takes an entire 10-second animation loop to pick up anything. I'm all for little bonus animations\, but I didn't need to watch the entire process of Arthur crafting his arrows ONE BY ONE.-Feels weird to say this\, but the game is TOO long. I'm more than 80 hours in\, and I barely finished the main storyline plus the epilogues while being fairly focused on doing them in priority. The problem is\, it's not long because the scenario's taking its time. No. It takes time because you sometimes have to ride across the entire 180 km² map to reach the next objective\, or walk (not run\, walk) through all of Saint-Denis.This game made by any other studio would be worth a 5. But Rockstar's sheer attention to detail and quality of writing bring it up to 6. That is purely out of respect for the team's dedication to creating a world that feels alive and characters that actually are.Happy New Year.… Expand",True,0.16591948,0.006904602,0.034300596,0.058475737,0.10425757,0.02181799

Slowing down the pace and really soaking in the game this time around has made me garner a greater appreciation for this mesmerizing open world. The slow pace of the game is not for everyone and those who blaze through the story will have missed a whole lot. That's what I see now that I'm taking my time. The game has some flaws to be sure\, but it is a near masterpiece if not an outright masterpiece depending on what your game preferences are.The open world design on display here will be the golden standard moving forward for creating living\, breathing game worlds. In that regard Rockstar have outdone themselves. I agree that some of the gameplay is clunky and the story is about as linear as it gets these days. Still the amount  love and work poured into this game really shines through overall. I say take the advice of a lot of online sites and play the game as slowly as possible to soak it all. Go explore\, find treasure\, hunt\, etc. Spend some time in the towns. On a second playthrough and I\""m not even bored yet. I can't believe how much I actually missed on the first run.It's not perfect as there some glitches and well let's say the bounty system is kind of rigged and wonky at times. The law will basically always side against you in confrontation and it seems pretty unfair at times. Other times I had no idea if I was experiencing a glitch\, logic fail\, or if the bounty system was working as intended but just badly designed. I had some issues with the story overall\, but that's really personal preference.ON the other hand\, I love the slow paced nature of the shooting mechanics and all the stuff some people find tedious and unnecessary I find really helps provide total immersion in the game playing as newly iconic character\, Arthur.Online\, well that's another story. The same basic gameplay but a barebones world as compared to SP. There is work to be done there for sure.Overall though\, I would give this game a 9.5 if I could\, but have no problems giving it a ten here. I think it's up there with Witcher 3 as the games of the generation. It's truly a special product and you can see the love that Rockstar put into this. The level of detail is astounding. You can say it's unnecessary even\, but it's there and it brings the world to life like no other game previously. Is it perfect? Nope\, but what game has ever been? There are some flaws\, but the overral package is amazing. I recommend that you shirk the naysayers and don't deprive yourself of the experience of playing this game.

I wanted to see for myself what the fuss was all about. While I loved the world\, story and characters in that game\, I felt that the controls were clunky and not responsive enough and the menus subpar\, all of which somehow lowered the quality of my playtime.So when Red Dead Redemption 2 was released and many players complained about the same gameplay issues in addition to too many animations and a very slow pace\, I was skeptical. I didn't start the game for another month because of a fear to be disappointed. I waited until the moment was right for me to start it. And what an adventure it has been.Yes the pace is slow\, yes the way Arthur Morgan controls is sometimes slow and clunky (especially in the camps and areas where you're not supposed to run)\, yes button mapping is not ideal and leads to the occasional unwanted fights and bounties on your head. Yes\, there is an animation for almost every action and it can takes quite some time to loot all the ennemies down after a gun fight. This is all frustrating. Yes\, the fast travel is limited. However\, in my mind\, this is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The positive points for RDR2 far outshine the negatives.The world around you feels alive\, with more possible interactions that you could ever dream of. The graphics are stellar and the panoramas stunning (I wish there was a real photo mode in the game). The map itself is beautifully designed and varied with many biotopes\, there are more details in this game that one can discover in 200 hours of play time. The story is very well written and moving. It's slow to build up but that is the time necessary to get attached to the characters and really feel it. As far as I can remember it is the only game that made me shed a tear and felt like a gut punch. The characters are deep and it is a pleasure to discover their lives and interact with them.The game is long\, and the slow pace allows you to take it all in and is essential to the overall experience. Do I wish that there was a more extensive and more practical fast travel system ? Yes maybe... But actually no. Because now that I finished the game I fondly remember all these hours riding around on my beloved horse\, I remember this feeling that I was actually travelling somewhere to accomplish something\, and not just choosing a location on a map and teleporting to it\, admiring these landscapes along the way\, hearing all those sounds. I almost feel nostalgic about it now. As if I went on an adventure with a group of friends. I want to talk about my experience with people as if I lived it myself. Listening to music tracks from the game transport me immediately back to these days.In conclusion\, what an experience that was. It was something completely new\, a game with which I interacted like no other games before. Despite its shortcomings\, Red Dead Redemption 2 is not really a game\, it's an adventure that takes you for a wild ride all while sitting in your couch.

Things that make the game one of my biggest disappointments in 2018 as a result\, even though others would argue it's \""perfect\"" and deserves a 10 rating. I am here to tell you as a huge fan of the series it is NOT perfect and here's why.The ControlsFirst off the controls in this game are questionable at best and downright obnoxious at worst. Upon starting this game I was greeted by some of the worst aiming and sensitivity I have ever encountered thus far in my PS4 gaming experience. it was a terrible first impression and coming from a PC with perfect 1:1 accuracy and no acceleration with a gaming mouse is bad enough\, but this was just on another level. I had to go on the internet and find an aim optimization guide just to bare playing the game\, I know this may seem nit picky and to be honest it is\, but it was really that bad (for me anyway.)My second gripe of the control system is the horses. Red Dead Redemption 1 had a slight learning curve with the controls for the horses you ride throughout the wilderness but it was something you were able to fully come to grips with in only a few minutes. It felt great and no other game had really felt that good with horse controls to me since (The Witcher 3 for example). Why Rockstar decided to change this in Red Dead 2 is quite frankly beyond me - I get that the horses in the original game were way too fast for a horse and were almost like sports cars\, but keeping the same controls and nerfing the speed of the horse would have been preferable in my opinion. In the end I am used to the horse controls now in Red Dead 2 but I definitely was expecting them to use the same control scheme as it would have been recognizable to the fans of the series and only a slight learning curve would be had for the new players.THE SHOOTING/COCKING MECHANISMWhy oh why Rockstar have you made the cocking mechanism of the gun as the same button as the fire button. I don't understand it and it is so obnoxious to have to spam fire in gun battles and the game actually suffers as a result of this - because what will end up happening is the game will recognize that extra pull of the R2 you did in that rapid spam fire-reload-fire and when you think you are done shooting you end up cocking and firing your weapon once more when you didn't want to. It is a terrible disappointment as the first game was so smooth and fluid. Apart from this I have no other real issue with the controls I think movement is solid and with some adjusting I got used to aiming too\, I just wish the cocking was R1 and the firing R2. It would just make so much more sense to me.FreedomThis game is an open world sand-box \""do what the F you want\"" game yet it strips control away from you at any given time. During missions\, I have to walk when the game wants me to\, I have to go in this specific area over here to hide my wagon to complete this one mission (which makes the game UNPLAYABLE without the mini radar in the bottom left of the screen)\, I have to walk throughout camp and my horse can't go over into the camp and I can't look at my weapon wheel or even think about having my gun out. WHY NOT? If I want to full sprint with my horse while shooting a gun in the air as I use my camp as a bowling alley with the tenants being the pins\, WHY CAN'T I? I just wish this game would give you the option to be an a**hole if you want to be! It is such a missed opportunity that I have to do exactly what the game wants me to or I die or I am just not able to do what I want at all or the game doesn't progress. I guess I understand the logic behind all of this as it makes the game more \""cinematic\"" but for goodness sake I don't want to watch a movie I want to play a video game\, let me be a jerk and do silly video game shenanigans while pretending to be a damn cowboy.8/10. Great\, not perfect. The visuals\, the music\, the setting\, the cast\, the story\, the dialogue\, the voice acting - it's all fantastic but the game suffers as a result of some poor decisions made by Rockstar for their sequel to one of my favourite games of all time. I just wanted more.… Expand",True,0.10609736,0.005264282,0.023193322,0.030044744,0.07223598,0.016638106

Do I really need toRed Dead Redemption 2 (RDR 2) is a very interesting game\, not because of its storytelling\, or graphics\, but perhaps for the precedent it may set in the gaming industry. It begs the fundamental question: What is a video game? Certainly\, RDR 2 IS a video game\, but it's infused with several mechanics that may be considered mundane\, and unnecessary by gaming standards. Do I really need to clean my gun\, brush my horse\, take baths\, and feed myself in a video game? RDR 2 insists I do. There is certainly no shortage of tasks to complete in the game. in fact\, there may be too many for most players. Even after an expansive tutorial\, there is still a massive amount of things to learn in RDR 2\, and many times\, it's up to the player to figure them out on their own. RDR 2 is a very long game\, with deliberate\, and methodical pacing. Admittedly\, I didn't finish the game. I grew weary of the overly-long conversations that occur in nearly every story mission\, and found myself wanting to skip forward to the short\, but fun gameplay segments. I began to have the most fun when I ventured out on my own into the wilderness and encountered an unsuspecting gang camping by a riverbank\, or engaged in a self-directed hunting expedition. RDR 2 isn't a bad game\, but the controls could certainly be better\, and there's a gigantic learning curve. The graphics are perhaps the best-to-date on consoles\, and the soundtrack/voice-acting are both top notch. but RDR 2 fails on a fundamental level for me. I simply wasn't having much fun playing the game. And that's a big problem. I asked myself the question: Will I ever play this game again after I beat the story missions? I realized I would not\, even if it was simply to engage in side missions or free-roam for my own enjoyment. And I absolutely would never re-play the story missions again. After the grandeur has faded there's simply not much to enjoy in RDR 2 for me. The game is superbly polished\, but beneath the beautifully veiled facade\, it's a pretentious\, drawn out experience with only a few moments of excitement that occur in an otherwise tiresome journey. Ultimately\, the fun factor has been sacrificed for realism and immersion. I hope this is not the future of the gaming industry.… Expand",True,0.09112182,0.0060272217,0.019475231,0.02283525,0.06495911,0.023371955

I couldn't believe this is a 2018 game. When you push your left stick\, the character won't immediately move.Whenever I wanted to interact with something or somebody\, if you are not perfectly positioning yourself\, you will not be able to succeed.So you want to do some minor adjustments about your positioning or facing direction. Then you realize that the clumsy character won't move or just moved too much.There are actually two sets of controls you have to learn\, or you'll get into big trouble. When you have your gun in your hand\, you have to be very careful because pressing L2 means point your gun to someone\, not to interact with. So you'll get yourself wanted very fast.You are going to do a lot of fetch quests in which you have to ride your horse by constantly pressing button X\, and you just kill/chase one or two bad guys and go back. This is no better than any other open-world games\, and not even remotely close to those fun quests in BOTW.And you're about to do a lot of chores in RDR2\, which actually is not fun. I do not understand why anybody could think it fun.I even expected to wash my plate after the first time i've eaten something\, while Rockstar didn't give me this option.Hunting is fun\, but rewards are little and I won't bother doing this much. You can't hunt while doing a quest 'cause you'll lose things you hunted.What's even worse about this game is the bounty part. You get yourself wanted usually because of : 1. clunky control (run into someone with your horse or accidentally pressing wrong buttons resulting in shooting someone) 2. self-defense. If you kill\, your bounty goes higher even if nobody saw it; if you don't\, you'll get killed.Do yourself a favor to not buy this game\, or at least read more honest reviews before buying the most disappointment probably in your gaming life.… Expand",True,0.4013387,0.023076924,0.105256535,0.24767025,0.2453505,0.029069828

I will keep short here since many most helpful reviews did a great job of criticizing the bad things. Besides\, I might revise my review later once I am done with the game.Major Pros- Amazing Detailed World- NPCs feel like real persons. Many different dialogues.- Hunting feels fantastic- Side activities are good\, I love hunting down wanted criminals.- Various mini games. (I like poker game)Major Cons- Control is weird and need a lot of memorizing (But become less problem once you get used to it). You may need to check online for clearer explanation of control since ingame does not give you a controller mapping. (why  ?)- No Fast travel in early game ( You need to upgrade camp to get fast travel ability but it costs a lot)- Law is too restrict. Bumping someone can easily lead to gunfight and you get a fine for murderer. This is not right. In real life situation\, you should be able to apologize- Chores - can't skip taking a bath.- Lack of freedom in term of choices. Most of the times\, you will have only 2 choices\, good or bad\, nothing in between. For example\, there was a main mission that I had to talk with the priests\, I could only talked politely with them\, like I was interested in their religion\, or choked their leader to dead. This felt wrong to me. I should have been able to aim my gun and threaten them to go away.- No quick save- Main character attitude is unlikable for me. I personally don't like his voice as well.In Sum\, RDR2 is great in detailed world but not as great in gameplay. It is still a good fun game if you have patience but the realistic should be optional. For people who want fast paced game\, devs should give a choice to skip chore scenes and allow fast travel at the beginning of the game.. For those who hasn't played the game yet\, I would advise to wait and see if Rockstar will have a patch to tone down the wanted system or not.

While it remains clunky there are some positive components. Killing an individual with a head shot or undertaking combat against a band of marauders feels satisfying. When firing weapons such as pistols\, shotguns\, carbines etc. the player can feel the kick of the weapon and the satisfying crackle it makes as you land a long distance shot killing a man from behind cover with a head shot. Other mechanics that assist the adrenaline of combat is the cover and dead-eye system.  Combining the characters movement with the slow-motion gunslinger ability adds an interesting dynamic. It doesn't feel inherently overpowered and requires a bit of experience. When finally mastering this mechanic it not only makes you feel like your a character within a spaghetti western but provides a further sense of satisfaction to the combat when you eventually start unloading lead on 5 or 6 men with impeccable accuracy.Atmosphere:From the gritty mud roads of Valentine to the New Orleans inspired Saint Denis\, everything from characters\, interactions\, locations and small details cooperate together to produce one of the most artistically driven atmospheres in recent video game history. Rockstar's new game world provides a great sense of location variety offering almost every type of player an area that feels interesting to them.Addressing many of the major issues from previous rock star games such as Grand Theft Auto where the world although large felt empty. RDR2 makes everything feel much more alive. Walking through towns you can see character's day to day routines\, different community's mannerisms and how they interact with you\, the player. Committing an act of violence on a town won't be forgotten and important decisions that you make affect the population's opinion of your character.This combined with little details such as personality in the most obscure of characters and emotional and dialogue responses to actions you have committed provides one of the best senses of consequence and realism that's on the market today.Not having appreciation for these elements is self-evident in many of these low meta critic reviews\, as it doesn't provide for people who only want to shoot and listen.Story:The main narrative of RDR2 is decent at best. It offers a compelling enough story about Arthur Morgan and his cohorts and it does provide extra fan service and lore around the universally loved John Marston. While compelling at times\, many interesting ideas are thrown away the moment a mission is completed. With some missions feeling uninteresting and bland at times.Pros-Great graphics & sound design-Deeply immersive atmosphere-Impeccable attention to detail-Decently sized map-Unique interactions with characters-A satisfying sense of discovery-A well designed healing system-Decisions that matterCons:-Combat can be irritating-Story isn't consistently entertaining-Certain quest lines don't have an overall effect on your character when they should… Expand",True,0.2763787,0.010604858,0.049761772,0.13969865,0.1554785,0.027688526

I think coming from PC to a PS4 exacerbated this\, as well as my lack of love for Sony's controllers. At about twelve hours in I was ready to give up; I was considering returning or selling the PS4 Pro bundle\, and I also started browsing other games. And while I do still think the controls can be cumbersome\, now at forty hours in\, and having punched horses tethered next to mine too many times\, by attempting to mount my horse\, I've finally been able to simply get over it. At this point when I do play the game I find it difficult to stop. Graphically the game is stunning (aside from character faces). The audio is the real gem for me - sometimes I wish I can go to sleep with my character parked in one of the minor towns... It's among the best I've ever seen in that department. Further\, everything has dialogue. I have no issues with the gun play\, and again here\, the audio puts the cherry on top. Most of the missions are very engaging with the exception of the scripted chases that get a little cliche. I do wish Rockstar would review the missions in their games where you have to sprint after someone requiring you to tap a button fast enough to cause carpal tunnel - it's seriously getting old and it's in no way fun or enjoyable - it's a chore. I still find the bounty/wanted system a bit wonky; at times\, while in a new set of clothes and mask et al\, when robbing a train I am quickly identified. The bottom line is this game is worth every penny. There are no micro-transactions (yet) which a lot of developers should take note of. The pace of the game is also perfect; with so much on hand that you can do the pace allows you to thoroughly explore the game and its regions... To the point where I find myself not wanting to move to the next chapter quite yet. This and AC Odyssey are the only two games this year that the asking price is actually worth the product. Anyone owning a console should own this game; I came from PC and purchased a PS4 bundle to get my hands on the game with no regrets. Is it perfect? Nothing is. But it's damn close.In the end the reader will have to take what I am saying here\, and many others\, with a grain of salt\, as many of us aren't even done with the game.

I found the immersion incredible and after a while\, I realized that playing the game was more about being in the environment than just executing the next goal; the environment was so rich\, I often found myself avoiding the next main story objective\, wanting instead to explore and enjoy the little things.I think this is one of the reasons I find RDR2 so good. After about 10 hours in\, that feeling came back – I just wanted to be in the environment. The missions are fun\, and the story is the best story I’ve found in a game\, and so\, consequently\, I’m not in a rush to see it finish; it’s like when you realize you’re watching a really fantastic movie\, and you don’t want it to end. A game offers the opportunity to immerse yourself in an environment more fully than a movie\, and a correctly constructed open-world game allows you to do it at a leisurely pace rather than race from task to task\, and still enjoy the time as it passes. If not\, why bother making it open world? The world itself has to be the star of the show\, as much as the missions\, story\, or anything else.I’ve played most open world games. Character movement is better in other franchises. Gunplay is better elsewhere\, inventory management has better implementation examples in any number of other titles. However\, as much as I love the other open worlds out there\, none is quite as impressive to me as RDR2. The thought put into it is evident. The scale of the accomplishment is impressive. Dialogue between characters is exceptional\, and when I compare it to many recent titles it makes them look lazy and amateur. Though it has bugs\, I’ve encountered very few\, which is a nice\, refreshing change compared to the normal bug set I usually get from Bethesda or Ubisoft. This game not only feels polished\, but contains all kinds of extra things that have exceeded my expectations in delightful ways. I’m not yet finished with the main story\, though I feel like I’m close to the end – and I’m ready to give it the award for best story in a video game. The writing is superb.I acknowledge that some of this has to do with a fondness and sentimentality for RDR. To their credit\, Rockstar seamlessly knitted RDR2’s prequel story into the beginning of RDR\, and they knew exactly how to hit all the right emotional buttons for anyone who loved the 2010 title.There are always negative reviews of things. Some of the negative reviews I’ve read are\, of course\, not at all my experience. I’m 50+ hours into RDR2 and I’ve loved every minute of it; I don’t want it to end. A lot of it comes down to personal preference. In the seven years between RDR and RDR2\, I played a lot of other open world games\, and I realized very quickly into RDR2 that the pace of those games was not what the environment of West Elizabeth was all about. I remembered thinking to myself halfway through the game that someone who wasn’t patient was probably going to hate RDR2. Patience has its rewards\, and sure enough\, it made for an extremely rich\, emotional experience story-wise\, something I rarely – if ever – get from the other titles I’ve played. There’s plenty of action in this game if you want to engage action\, but there’s also the slow pleasure of a casual poker game or a horse ride just to see the sights (as opposed to a ride to get to the start of a mission). Since I find the environment so enjoyable\, the game works for me whereas it might not for someone who just wants to execute the main story as quickly as possible.I’m not unfamiliar with that desire; there are some games where I just want to get to the end because the world isn’t rich enough to hold my attention. With RDR2\, as much as I want to complete the full story\, I never want it to end…probably because it’ll be another seven years for a sequel.It’ll be worth waiting for if it’s this well made and executed. Hat’s off\, Rockstar. You’re like the Kubrick of video gaming. Not a lot of output\, but when you do…wow. Thanks for the good work.… Expand",True,0.057005897,0.0049209595,0.015154205,0.01819439,0.050930742,0.015429466

They won’t be wrong it isn’t a bad game at all\, but I will talk about the game without the rose-colored glasses on for a bit and tell you that Red Dead Redemption 2 is a fantastic game with some noticeable flaws.You are part of an infamous outlaw gang on the run from the law from beginning to the end. The gang you play is from the first game\, but unlike the first one you don’t get any real new questions to ask just more answers. Let me explain. In the first you hear stories of Johns past and you can imagine what it was like. This game being a prequel they take time to only answer without really setting up anything new to the characters or any real new backstory to the ones from the first game.  Arthur is your new main character that for the most part you can customize throughout the game. He is a good fit\, but compared to other character in the gang you ride with he is way less interesting.  I would have liked to play as the gang’s leader Dutch and get a closer glimpse into his madness. He is by far the most interesting character and I only wish he was the focus of the story. The campaign is long and the story has many cinematic moments that make you truly feel like an old west cowboy which is all we can ask for.The gameplay however is where more of my gripes come into play. The biggest one is the fact the game doesn’t know when to end. It has a good 4+ hour epilogue that they split into two parts. Rockstar typically speaking epilogue isn’t that long hell at max I’d expect 30 minutes. This wouldn’t be a problem if the 4 hours were action packed or emotionally engaging. Instead you do chores for half of it. Look I can shovel **** in real life I don’t need a game for that experience. I also couldn’t stand the horse mechanics in this game. I hate that I couldn’t fast travel and whistle for my horse because the dumb beast wasn’t near. My personal favorite which in fact made me fail a couple of missions is my horse’s ability to run head first into a tree. I did this more times than is funny\, and after a while I almost shot the damn thing because that is such a stupid thing to include in a game with horses. I can ride my horse through a forest in The Witcher and get out unscathed\, but in Red Dead I get near a tree and this stupid animal rams head first into itself preservation be damned. I want to end on a good note so I will talk about the gunplay. I love how the guns feel in this game. I chose the more powerful slightly slower weapons in the game but I felt it. I also adored when the missions would have you do these scripted scenes that felt like they were ripped out of a western movie.  The world felt so alive that the town\, random strangers\, hell even the shops all remembered you and your actions.Overall Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game and will still manage to make my top five games of the year. Some will love it more than me and that is fine it is a solid game. The things that annoyed me just really irked me to the point of not having a good time. In the end it is like 90% fantastic and like 10% not I give it still a full price.… Expand",True,0.27236435,0.016254602,0.089145996,0.15236975,0.16869035,0.04718852

77760,RDR2,2018-11-21,8.0,"[Minor spoilers]I can't add much to the positives\, those are given by many already and to reiterate\, I have nothing to add to these many positive points. Unmatched graphics\, compelling story (although temporarily)\, and a detailed world to explore that we haven't seen the likes of in our lives. The hunting\, fishing and the mini-games are some of the most fun things I've ever done in video-games albeit that they are a little unrewarding. But there are some more things that need to be said.Quickly going over it\, I'll start by saying that this game sets a new standard for the games of the future. Yet it also struggles with problems that should be way in the past by now. Most notably the controls. Most of the time they're unresponsive\, clunky\, and unsatisfactory. The gunplay is arcade-like with a pop-out-of-cover system that's downright bad. This makes the many missions in the game that involve multiple shooting galleries thrown at you in the form of waves of enemies very tedious. Moving your character feels like you're driving a vehicle\, it doesn't feel organic. Whenever I try to stand in front of a desk or something of the like to grab something it feels like I'm parking a truck into a loading bay. The horses don't have a mind of their own outside of missions. This is particularly notable when you look back whilst being chased\, perhaps to fire but after mere seconds your horse bumps into a tree or rock that is right in front of it. Another nuisance would be that the game is so full of wildlife that your horse runs over a rabbit about every five minutes of riding. Guns are selected for you in missions and magically appear on your back. To change them back to your preferred set is a chore you'll quickly get tired of. The list goes on. The fluidity and realism in this game is inconsistent.It's these things and the very numerous amount of bugs and glitches that really wear this game down over time as you play it. Especially the story\, from Chapter 5 onwards it gets mediocre at its best. It's full of retcons\, loose ends\, and plot-holes. One example would be John Marston's daughter. We never heard a word about that. Another would be that in the first game it was mentioned that John left the gang after having been abandoned during a bank heist. We experience said heist happen\, but he still runs with the gang for a while after that. As a final example\, we never heard a word of Sadie and Charles in the  first game despite them being both alive in the end. It's clear that Red Dead Redemption 2 was not planned or if it was\, it surely lacks in some of the writing. Although\, the first half of the story is stellar. The new characters are something to take note of\, too. You really feel as if these people in the game are relatable. That's what makes them so well-written. It's merely that the story that accompanies these characters could've been better and more realistic. Chapter 5 is what particularly puts me off. It seemed like a tool to skip over some time in the story. In my eyes that particular chapter was pure lazy writing from beginning to end. The epilogue suffered a lot as well. It's length was by no means justified and provided little to nothing to the story. Some parts of the story could've been cut out entirely and it would've been just fine. Dare I say more concise and polished.To add\, this game falls short in terms of feeling natural. It focuses on realism and the fact that this is your version of Arthur Morgan yet it insults that when you find that your choices in this game mean nothing at all. It also focuses so much on 'realism' that it becomes downright annoying. I have to keep track of my weight otherwise I suffer consequences but in order to do that I to either hunt or buy food for a ludicrous amount of money and then cook it one by one. Or I could eat 10 cans of beans. Right. It just feels unnecessary and particularly unrewarding. It's things like this that are in contrast to the rest of the game which is a movie-like experience.It is overall a great game but it really suffers from lack of polishing as well from it's own elements. This is a game that developers can learn a lot from in the future. As much from the good as from the bad. Thank you for reading my first ever review. Have a good day.… Expand",True,0.079250954,0.0034332275,0.021183543,0.025542418,0.059948977,0.012440704

And after a short while you'll be popping head-shots here and there. Horse-riding is great and I find myself preferring this method of navigation more than fast travelling so that I can enjoy the awesome environment and meeting weird strangers on the road.Hunting is a bit of a mixed bag as they have introduced a new 3-star system rating the quality of the game. You'll have to stop\, observe\, and then choose the right weapon to kill it for the perfect pelt. This\, although quite fun on paper\, impacts a little bit on the experience. Because hunting is not really necessary except for collecting perfect pelts in order to upgrade and craft pouches\, clothing and your settlement. I find myself spending a bit too much time in searching and hunting. And if you don't perform a perfect kill\, the quality of the pelts will be knocked down and  you'll have to do it all over again...StoryIt was great! For a big fan of the first installment\, it was a great ride. It helped flesh out the old known characters and at the same time introduce new distinct ones. The story made sense and is impact-ful. It is a well written prequel to the original RDR. I don't want to spoil the story so i'll leave it right here. All I can say is it will be able to satisfy old fans and new comers.The side missions add even depth to the main character as well. Sometimes some stranger missions will let you know more about his past and have more insights into his nature. while other missions have surprising easter eggs that will leave you smiling if you understood what it meant. I'd strongly suggest people not to miss these stranger missions as it is the best way Rockstar had made use of this side mission mechanics so far. and i hope they would keep on doing this to their upcoming franchises (GTA 6 maybe? please?)Graphics and mechanicsDespite the fake HDR thing that's a bit of a let down. This game looks gorgeous in SDR! the dynamic weather system feels realistic and interacts with you. rains pour on you and your horse. mud gets splashed onto the horse as you ride through it. strong winds affect Arthur's walking animation. And most importantly\, the horse's balls shrink or hang lower depending on the temperature!Small details are put into the game everywhere. you'll smell when you haven't taken a shower for a long time and animals will be able to detect you from a longer distance than usual. animal carcasses will progressively rot if left on the ground. Your horse poops and complains about walking through tough bushes.One little gripe i had with the game is the way your horse follows you to the next fast travel location on the train. nearly every time whenever i took the train to St Denise it will become suicidal and walks into the train causing it to be knocked back and drop any large items stowed on it.In short.Stunning game\, didn't like the hunting… Expand",True,0.09033044,0.0064086914,0.019374741,0.020256994,0.08807703,0.039947584

77775,RDR2,2018-12-12,7.0,"I'm gonna split this into two: the online and the story.Story: The story was absolutely perfect. Whoever wrote this game should get a reward\, the dialogue is great\, the characters are well written\, the soundtrack is my favorite Rockstar soundtrack ever. Everything was perfect\, but the game hits a low point after the Saint Denis bank heist gone wrong. Your ship somehow sinks\, you somehow find every gang member on the ship together\, and you somehow get caught up in a war. It just seems random. Games like five finger fillet\, poker\, or just sitting around a campfire at night with the gang is enjoyable. The free world is even better\, the amount of detail Rockstar put in this game is incredible. One of the main problems of this game\, though\, is the shooting. Rockstar holds your hand and once you turn off aim assist\, it's like Arthur is blind. The cover system is the worst too\, and it's downright annoying. Overall\, the story is a 4.5/5The online mode- Online is fun in the beginning\, you get busted out and in the finale you get to suit up like ghetto iron Man\, but from there it gets a bit slow and grindy. Game modes are fun to play\, but the free-world is just so stripped of the story mode. They got rid of the side games like poker or five finger fillet\, which would've been fun to play with friends. Fishing is the only game you have in online\, but it's such a chore to have to rank up\, get a bow\, have to upgrade that bow.

77776,RDR2,2018-11-23,9.0,"Before I get deep I would like to explain my experience with you so that you can judge my critiques and such based on my experience. NO SPOILERS!----I played RDR2 on the PS4-release\, not the best way to play this game as its aged hardware is shown in the performance and average load-temps of the console.----I have completed the game 76% my first run\, and then I 85% completed it a second run... there is just too much to do. I believe I have a total of 100-120 hours sunk into this game as-of November 24\, 2018. I am working on a 3rd play through which I will experiment with decisions and different hunting methods earlier than I did the other two.Now\, to the straight forward stuff. Basic\, need to knows.----Ups:-  Beautiful: This game is on of the best looking games out today and will not be aging badly for some time.- Story: It's no secret that Rockstar puts a lot of effort into making their stories tick like a clock\, but this one knocked me off my chair. Not only did it tie up all the stories that needed to be answered from RDR1\, but it gave me a new vision of what I had questioned about so many years ago. Great writing and pacing allows this almost 8 season long TV series\, continue to intrigue and cause me to think deep\, even after several runs. Characters make their own decisions that impact those around them\, and Arthur is not told what he needs to think\, he comes to his own conclusions and begins to do what he believes is best... Amazing to see a characters with actual humanity.- The Living World: The massive open world was to my surprise almost half the size of GTA 5 which at first made me hesitant. But the in gaming\, the worlds size only shows it's true form through travel and experience through it; RDR2's world is living\, which means every NPC has it's own life it must attend to as you rob trains and steal wagons. The animals behave correctly to situations\, and stay together in herds or stay solitary\, depending on the species. The world's environment feels real\, not some half-ass'd forest shooter... FC4/5.- Things to do: Most games today have filler content inside their world to occupy the time of the gamer. Games like most of the AC franchise abused this\, making it a very unwanted approach to open worlds. RDR2 thought does not have filler\, it has a living\, breathing world. People need assistance\, animals behave according to your actions\, NPC town folk respond to your decisions. You could either rob the store\, or gain enough honor so that you get good discounts. Hunting\, fishing\, story missions\, side quests\, and random events are all triggered by the player\, and this is a constant and it is rare for the triggered events to be similar to the last 10 or so that the player has been either subjected to or suggested to do.-  The Ending Spoilers!!!: The ending was majestic\, gracious\, and fulfilling. I had the good ending\, so Arthur died with fulfillment of his goal of delivering John safely to a future without outlaws and the untamed westerners. Arther's character arch is satisfying and give the player a sense of a grander scope that Rockstar has built this world into\, a universe that mirrors ours. The west has been taimed...-----Downs:-  Performance: On the older console\, it does not run well. The PS4 does it's best so it's not the games fault that it's too beautiful. The XBOX One X though has amazing textures and performance\, as comparing my PS4 to my friends XBOX X in the town of Valentine\, the quality and performance were dramatically better on the newer\, superior hardware.-  Controls: The controls are the same with almost every other Rockstar game\, clunking\, and filled with different set configurations like half-pulled R2 or RB to prepare to draw for a duel. The aiming is extremely dependent on aim-assist and you would figure that Rockstar would have learned after 4 games but\, at this point I think it's just their trade-mark now.-  Chapter 5 Spoiler!!!: This chapter slows the game\, with repetitive missions of go\, shoot\, slowly walk\, shoot\, leave/escape. It is a refreshing and nice break from the Pinkerton's and the other stresses of the Lemoyne\,  New Haven\, and such. This chapter could have been done better I believe\, with at the beginning\, Arthur so happens to wash up only hundreds of feet from his buds\, and the ship they were on also gets into a storm... just their luck.- Transition into the Epilogue: After the end of chapter 6\, the epilogue begins. But what happens in the end of chapter 6 is very strong\, and had me shocked\, awed\, and emotional for more than a couple of minutes\, more like hours. But instead of slowing down and just letting the player realize what had happened\, to ingest the importance of the events\, it slings you into John Marston's farm simulator for a whole half-hour.----ConclusionBuy this game... even at a premium price. The experience is amazing for those who enjoy a good story with sophisticated story telling.… Expand",True,0.25084448,0.012574885,0.033011556,0.07333439,0.13344458,0.014738814

Accompanied by a story that features a diverse cast of well written and engaging characters that invest you in their story. This isn't a great game because it's flawless\, it's a great game because the things it does well\, it does exceptionally well and those things at least to me\, matter far more than more minor albeit frustrating concerns that many have already addressed.The controls are a bit clunky they take some getting used to and they will probably get you into trouble a few times in the early game\, once you catch on to the pace of the game and have familiarized yourself this issue largely fades into the background. Another problem that has always plagued Rockstars games is insanely linear mission design\, the story being told is well worth this irritation but failing missions at the drop of a hat for not going about it the way the devs wanted you to is a weirdly incongruous approach for a game where outside of missions you can go anywhere and do anything. This isn't to say the missions are bad\, just overly restrictive to the point where they aren't using the game to its fullest potential.These gripes aside though the game never failed to keep me invested with an immense amount of content to appeal to all kinds I can see myself taking my time with this to 100% it as I do so few games these days as most of them are loaded down with unnecessary busywork\, this games side activities require more thought and as such I don't feel like I'm just checking boxes.I can see some being turned off by slow pace of the game as the realism certainly gets in the way of efficiency\, but it makes the game feel all the more authentic and I was happy for the trade off personally\, The gamey nature of hunting in games like Assassin's Creed always turned me off so this is a great change of pace.Overall I think regardless of whether it's your cup of tea the boundaries Red Dead Redemption 2 pushes are hard to deny in terms of world design at the very least.

Sooooo boring. The gameplay really is complete **** by modern standards.

To me\, it feels like a TV show\, a passive sort of entertainment\, and that is a problem. I find myself considering playing but instead turning on netflix because it doesn't require I hold a controller. And it honestly is heartbreaking because I really was itching for a big open world game like this to hop into\, but this just doesn't do it for me.I suppose you could say it is highly realistic what with having to brush your horse\, shave\, eat\, feed your horse\, grab weapons from the saddle every damn time\, ride long distances of mostly empty land. It's all very much like the Wild West we know from stories and shows and movies. The key difference though - movies don't follow every hour of every day of a cowboy. They highlight the exciting parts which are few and far between. They know the rest is just boring AF. This game seems to have forgotten that.

And Domino is by no way alone in this game.On the other hand\, are the gun fights\, which are surely less boring than Domino but not different by the amount you would expect. Auto-aim in this game is ridiculous- you can hit a hare with a bow while fast driving on horse with little to no effort. Combat is more about not getting hit and healing wounds than its about actually aiming because this part is automatic.I can usually tolerate boring tasks if they succeed in creating immersion. I did love the boring tasks in Kingdom come deliverance for one because I felled immersed into the character. but what works for a slow paced RPG does not work for a fast paced action shooter like RDR2. There was no way to fill immersed when playing a guy who is pretty much unbeatable from the start.So far\, I would say the best part of this game is the random events.

Ride 10 min to punch a guy who owes money once than ride 10 min back to camp. Then do that 3 more times! Ride 10 min to pick somebody up to ride 10 min to drop them off then ride back to camp. Ride 10 min to a hunting spot than hunt 1 animal than ride 10 min back to camp. If you hated FF15 and it's car mechanic well it's the same here. Bad boring mission design in a shockingly empty open world. The experience is also hampered by terrible movement mechanics. You walk at a snails pace as if your in Gears of War 1 talking on the radio and you can hold the sprint button to speed up... but you go to full speed automatically and as soon as you let go you are a snail again. Some how there is no jog option so you end up running past things you want or crawling up to them slowly. Shooting feels awful made worse by a awkward implementation of a cover system and the poor movement controls. The game also never seems to remember what weapons I have equipped. It always takes my long arms off my body even though they are hanging on my back not just keeping them on my horse but removing them forcing me to reopen the horse inventory. Maybe the game will improve if the story picks up. But right now it's painfully boring with long drawn out conversations about nothing important with idiots who's names I can't remember. As for the supposed amazing graphics... the best way to describe the game is blurry very blurry.I have now beaten the game. It will not be a game I remember fondly. There is only 1 mission in the whole game that I will remember and that was when you rolled up to that house to find the kid. I was really feeling that mission... too bad once you get there the shooting it terrible. I have serious problems with how nearly every single mission is designed and how almost all the story is delivered throughout the game. Everything is tedious without an upside after you bother going through it all. Less than half way through the game and I had all the money I would ever need and fully modified guns\, horse\, and clothes that I would never need to change. After that almost every side quest in the game was a absolute waste of time with a tiny bit of mediocre story that wasn't worth the travel time. I started to avoid everything and do a straight line for the necessary story line missions because I was done with the game but wanted to know the story. I wouldn't say it was bad but as it started to end I was disappointed with so many actions of the main character that I was totally taken out of the experience. In the rest of the game you can do whatever you want and totally create what type of person you are with your interactions with people. But in the main game I'm thinking \""**** you shot that person I liked you are dead\"". I shoot him mission failed. You also have to just shake your head at how stupid the major fight scenes are. You get 10 hours of 100 people shooting at you as you guys barely move or slowly ride away completely exposed and not a single ****ing person can hit anybody or your horses. It's too absurd for my taste... they needed to design fights better but the AI is so simple they have to throw waves and waves of enemies at you to even force you to move your character. Nothing in this world ever reflects anything that happens. You kill 5 times a towns population and then return the next day and everybody is there. You fight a rival gang that apparently has 1000 men and you have 20. Nothing makes sense… Expand",True,,,,,,

77937,RDR2,2019-03-29,8.0,"Red Dead Redemption 2 single player is a good game\, but it isn't without its flaws. When it came out I completely immersed myself into its world for a straight 3 weeks and I didn't want to leave. It was\, and probably still is the best looking game I've ever played on the PS4. it features some of the most breath taking\, life-like cities and towns ever rendered in video games to date for consoles. In addition\, the horse mechanics\, animations\, and physics (for people to\, like when you shoot them) were among the best I've experienced as well (especially if you shoot a horse while it's moving and watching it collapse to the ground in a realistic manner\, harming it's rider).The voice acting was great\, but the overall story was predictable and definitely slower paced and more boring then other sections of the game\, which did cause me to feel like\, \""I can't wait to get to the next part when **** goes down\"". The main missions and side quests were fun\, but I found myself wishing I had more options to approach and achieve objectives\, which did take me out of the experience sometimes. For example\, if you had to get money from someone who owed it to your gang\, your only real option was to go over and beat it out of them. What if you could sneak into their house at night and steal it? Or be presented with dialogue choices tied to charm or intimidation stats that could help you get what you wanted without strong arming anyone? I bring this up because I also felt like your ability to interact with NPCs was superficial. Your choices were basically 1.) Say something nice 2.) Say something mean 3.) Rob them 4.) Kill them or 5.) Ignore them and would yield a few different reactions including 1.) They'd appreciate the compliment 2.) They'd say something mean back or give a warning\, and start to get agitated 3.) Become hostile toward you 4.) Try to avoid you. After a while\, this feature felt more like a gimick then an immersive feature and a lot of the side quests would repeat even if you had already completed them. MINOR SPOILER: i think I sucked out the venom from a dude's leg at least 6 times\, and after the 5th time the same lady asked me a ride to town across the map in the opposite direction\, I just shot her because I'd see her again anyway good as new. I also didn't like the auto-aim feature because it really took away any sense of credible accomplishment during a gun fight\, but if you turned it off\, the reticle was the size of a dot\, making aiming manually almost impossible during horse chase sequences. I also felt frustrated with the cover feature because I would sometimes try to hide behind a rock in front of me during a gun fight\, but instead\, I would run around the side of the rock and take a lot of damage because I was out in the open. This occurred frequently enough to cause me some frustration with the gameplay. Finally\, I know this is pretty petty af. but whenever you died in the game\, you would just respawn a few feet away from where you were killed and that always took me out of the experience. I would have preferred the option to save during an altercation because then you could experiment with different weapons in different scenarios\, kind of like how you could with a game like Fallout 3. This way\, if you died you would either reload from a previous auto-save (which you could do) or dig through a manually saved file feeling like:\""ohh man\, I **** up. Their were real consequences\"" rather then just reload two feet away and be like \""who cares if I die\, I just respawn because I'm invincible\"".MAJOR SPOILER: Finally\, when you play as John\, I really did appreciate how the game walked you through the process of how he acquired the farm\, it was a great tie in to the first game and I do think it was necessary\, but it was also incredibly borning to play through with the exception of that one mission where you built the actual farm and proposed to Abigail. I know I gave this game a lot of criticism\, but I did genuinely enjoy it and it was a lot of fun.In regards to the online feature of RDR2\, when I played it a few months back\, I quickly lost interest. The economy in the game was completely broken and you had to grind an insane amount of hours to gain access to all the cool guns you used during the single player campaign\, so it felt like you were working toward something that you already should have or at least be able to earn more easily. The story for the online version was also relatively weak and was a hard sell for me\, especially considering the fact that you basically play as a mute the entire game and everyone you meet carries a conversation with you like that's totally normal.  The pvp felt very weak as well and I think that is because their are battle royale games with much better guns and maps then what RDR2 has to offer.

Controls took me about three solid days of playing to become totally comfortable with\, and once that happened\, any time I play\, I am not here.  I am there.  Total immersion.Graphics and design are unparalleled.  This sets the bar.  I didn't even know my PS4 could do what this game manages and it has all but ruined every other open world game I own (sorry Skyrim\, sorry Witcher 3).Gameplay is as varied as any Rockstar game.  In this one respect\, it is GTAV on horses\, it is Red Dead Redemption on ultra-steroids.  Play poker\, go fishing\, chill by a campfire telling stories\, rob a stagecoach\, go hunting\, watch a variety show\, wander the countryside\, whatever.  If you see it you can go there but good luck getting there without being interrupted by a half-dozen side quests.  The main quest is compelling and full of solid characters played by solid actors.Even though it sets the new bar\, it's not perfect.  I got frustrated (particularly in the early game) by how little personal agency I actually had.  When it comes to the main quests and side quests\, you are essentially on rails\, doing what the game wants you to do (rather than what you want to do).  It's impossible to play a totally \""good\"" guy\, and it's likewise impossible to play a totally \""bad\"" guy.  RDR2 makes you straddle that gap and ultimately always pushes you in the direction it wants for each event.  But I came to accept that limitation\, it's a small price to pay for the wonder of the world it lets you play in.  Controls are also not immediately intuitive\, there's a fairly steep learning curve\, and eventually you learn that changing weapons or outfits on the fly isn't quite as easy as it should be - sometimes you leave stuff on your horse that you need\, sometimes while flipping through the radials you hit the wrong thing - it's a little on the cumbersome side\, and every button on the controller is used with both short and long-presses which adds to the initial confusion.  Once you get it\, though\, and it starts to become second-nature\, it's hard to imagine any other way they could have done it.  A final thing to gripe about is just how often you are interrupted when you're trying to either do something else or just chill out.  There's almost always someone coming up to you asking you to do something and if you engage them\, you're suddenly back on your horse heading halfway across the map again.  A lot of people find travel tedious\, I don't\, so I can forgive this\, but it has caused me more than a few frustrating moments in the game where I was pulled away from what I really wanted to be doing.  Combined with the 'on-rails' feeling of quests\, there's very little actual player agency beyond making your guy look the way you want\, and choosing between somewhat arbitrary \""be a cool guy or be a dick\"" options throughout the game.  I dock it a point for these things.But that's a hard point to dock\, because this may be the greatest video game ever made\, to-date.  It's a huge\, living\, organic\, nearly photorealistic world and a total dream-come-true for fans of the western genre.  Your move\, Bethesda.  If they can make their next open fantasy world feel truly -this- alive\, I will be in heaven.  For now I'll do my business with a rifle.… Expand",True,,,,,,

The detail is insane and shows how much passion the developers had for the game\, most game developers are lazy and it shows\, like BO4 with water in Blackout mode worse than Ocarina of time on N64\, and does nothing when shot at.To address some silly/lying negative reviews:Games boring: The first chapter acts as a tutorial and introduces characters\, after it's free roam. The games huge and full of quality content and missions\, challenges\, activities\, easter eggs. It's not a childish game like Fortnite is COD BO4\, it's like a slow boiling Hollywood movie with a brilliant storyline and much to absorb.Clunky: The controls are like other Rockstar games\, if you can't grasp them you shouldn't be playing games as they're really not that hard and have a ton of configuring options. Free aim does need some configuration but otherwise it's all well thought out considering how many different actions there are to perform.You can kill animals it's evil: My favourite bad reviews are SJW people whinging because you can kill animals in it\, what do you think people did in 1899\, telegram just eat for desert grown potato salad? Or maybe go TK Maxx for a nike winter coat and cowboy hat. Vegetarian was what apache's called bad hunters\, veganism didn't exist until 1944. Even aggressive comanche Indians had 1-2 horses per every man/woman and live stock of several million wilderbeast/horses. Without live stock these silly people's ancestors probably would've starved. I love animals more than people but SJW's need to stop whinging because game developers choose to base a game on realism and history.It doesn't work good on pc: Really? The game isnt out on pc\, only consoles.4K/HDR isn't good: game HDR calibration to 500\, TV brightness to 47\, TV HDR dynamic contrast to high\, TV blacks to low\, TV colour temp 50. Result = sexy visuals. As standard HDR causes asharper cricket textured picture but a bit darker with washed out colours\, it could've been better off the bat\, maybe they'll patch it soon. But these settings on my LG TV created a lively vivid picture.Bounty system is broken: No\, it's realistic\, exit an area quick enough and no bounty. Commit crimes next to lawman and you'll be wanted with a bounty. Wear a mask after the crime and you'll be hidden but be threatened to remove it\, and if doing so will be recognized. Locked down towns go back to normal with time and bounties lessen with time. Chance clothes\, shave hair\, grow a beard\, you'll lose the bounty or won't be recognized as easily depending on severity of changes. If you can't handle evading some bounty hunters or lawman\, which is what the game is about believe it or not\, go join a gang of pansies\, not outlaws.And that's about it\, a truly impressive game that raises the bar for many lazy quick cash grab developers.… Expand",True,0.2853768,0.018836858,0.06749674,0.15414265,0.20016506,0.024753258

It is basically ripped from both those games. 10 hours is not long enough to really get good using it. It takes a second to really get proficient with it. Also\, to the idiots saying there's a delay. You have to pull the trigger again to make Arthur rack another round idiot. Guns haven't always been simi-automatic.2.) Not fun. Are you serious??? I mean literally go into town and play poker. Won/lose money. Get mad if you lose shoot the guy in the face and have a standoff with the law. Kinda like GTAV. Only difference if the law isn't gonna chase you at all costs and kill other people to get to you like in GTAV. Also. The beginning is slow. Its called character building. Get your 10 hours of play time out. Come back around 25.3.) Empty world. Once again are you daft? There are literally random events that can happen if you just ride around! Granted theres not ine around every corner\, but take some time and look. You get chain gang prison escapes\, (slight spoiler)kkk meeting that always end hilariously by them killing themselves and random people who need help.

78082,RDR2,2018-11-04,9.0,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game that many people will say is one of the greatest games of all time and perhaps one of the only games that people cant find often as a much more refined experience of open world shooter games\, for my case I can agree with that statement. Red Dead Redemption 2 offers amazing attention to detail in both story and game-play in which the player can really feelRed Dead Redemption 2 is a game that many people will say is one of the greatest games of all time and perhaps one of the only games that people cant find often as a much more refined experience of open world shooter games\, for my case I can agree with that statement. Red Dead Redemption 2 offers amazing attention to detail in both story and game-play in which the player can really feel the amount of effort that was put into the game\, nearly everything you do in this game is animated and the amount of realism can really blow your mind from how far Rockstar really went with this game. As much as I love the game as it is right now\, and that Red Dead Online hasn't been released yet\, I can only talk about the experience i have had so far from playing the game to explore\, and playing the game's story components.The game in my opinion has some of the best story writing people haven't seen for ages when it comes to AAA game franchises\, from people leaving games like Call of Duty or Destiny  to finally finding and playing a game that has some story in which it will really leave a memory for you. The game also offers really amazing graphics and a good amount of weapon selection\, and the players themselves feel like they have so many different things they can do in the game\, leaving endless opportunities to unfold and create their own story outside of the game's own story missions.The main issues I have with game (I play on a ps4) are the fact that the game has so many animations for what you do that sometimes they can feel like they are dragging you down from versatility of your own movement. As someone that plays on ps4 I feel I am not the only one having this issue. I cant really say the same for some PC players because they aren't the ones playing on a controller.Whenever I try to perform an action\, like for example moving a wagon with two horses on it\, often times ill see myself struggling to stop the horses even though I spam R1 (which is how you stop them)\, and often times whenever I do\, the horses will eventually get stuck on some rocks somehow\, and make them basically unable to move. This is probably just me being completely reckless with what I do however\, so take this sentence with a grain of salt for me being retarded as a player. But when it comes to actual movement in the game like I said before\, sometimes whenever you perform an action\, like taking food and such\, the movement will feel very heavy and clunky compared  to other games since literally everything you do has an animation\, eventually this will result in players like me feeling like that its more of a chore to go loot items or skin animals.When it comes to gun-play the weapons in this game are very satisfying and amazing to use that often times you will find yourself too busy indulging in how great the weapons are\, but when it comes to the different amount of weapons you can purchase and find\, i'm slightly disappointed in what they did with this game. As much as I love the amount of customization you can have with yourself and the guns\, the game just felt like there wasn't enough variety with what there was and that most guns feel like weaker re-skins of each other\, even though this statement can be gone against with saying that you can customize your weapons to the point where they will feel different\, but I feel as myself that even that isn't enough.As much as I love this game for the amount of effort put into it\, i'll leave a solid 9 for now seeing as that not every game is perfect\, but games like these will always have some sort of place in myself\, especially that even with some flaws the game has\, I myself am having a blast playing it.… Expand",True,0.057005897,0.0047302246,0.01191331,0.017292,0.045419596,0.021990653

However it took me about 15-20 hours of gameplay before I really started to enjoy the game.

I feel like between the dead eye and lick on combat becomes mundane like highlight your enemy’s and then watch them drop. But if you disable all of those things it’s so clunky and glitchy that you can’t really enjoy the combat at all.

Some open worlds are filled with content represented by points on a map to explore. IThis game is unlike anything I've ever played. The world is compelling visually and mind-boggling in its details. But it's not just a gallery to walk through and observe -- you can interact with it in many dynamic and interesting ways\, experimenting and trying different approaches to different situations. Some open worlds are filled with content represented by points on a map to explore. I think that's a bad design decision which removes the joy of discovery. Here\, visual and audio clues drive exploration\, and it's a joy to traverse through the same areas again and again because each time the developers have striven to make it a fresh experience.For example\, I've traveled to a town called Valentine countless times. Sometimes there's someone being mugged there at night\, or gang members will show up\, or a preacher will be preaching\, or a beggar begging. You can interact with each of these and it never seems to stop. Whether these are dynamic or scripted (and probably a combination of both)\, doesn't matter to me. Nothing in this world seems to be repeated.Many games have countless side quests\, and your time with the characters in each one is brief and not that interesting. Here\, there are extended side quests where you interact with a single character in a story arc. It's much more compelling.In essence\, if you like to explore a world AND interact with it\, you should get this game.The amount of excellent dialogue in this game is crazy\, especially with your fellow gang members. I'm constantly surprised when I go back to the camp; the gang seems to be talking about something else\, whether I'm listening in or not.The world has this feeling of going on without you.The game does have a slower pace; there are animations for just about everything. But I actually enjoy the slower pace\, and I feel like the game is more tactile and interactive because of it.My biggest gripe is that some systems are not explained very well. Just one for example\, why do I need to donate supplies to the camp apart from upgrades? Is there some benefit to that? The game needs to teach duels prior to a duel and not during a duel (where you have a super small time window to read the hints on the screen). Why do you have to walk so slowly at camp?Sometimes I also feel like there's too much going on. Eating constantly to gain weight is a drag\, constantly brushing your horse\, maintaining your guns. My OCD nature tells me I'm always forgetting to do something\, and there aren't ui warnings for all of these. I feel like especially maintaining weight is superfluous.But overall\, these do not detract from what's here. It's a very long game\, but because it's so engaging\, I imagine I'll be playing it for a very long time to get all the extra collectibles and whatnot.… Expand",True,0.11336674,0.0074386597,0.019475231,0.030375287,0.07999486,0.021645326

I wish Landon Ricketts from RDR1 would've been in the game but sadly his voice actor passed away a few years ago.I really missed the physics from GTA IV and RDR in GTA V\, which was the biggest disappointment of GTA V in my opinion. But with RDR2\, the great\, realistic and amusing physics are back. The world is amazing\, lots of animals\, lots of collectibles to find\, lots of characters to meet and lots of places to discover.When I'm riding around with my horse I stop pretty much every 30 seconds looking at the landscape\, studying and hunting animals\, exploring buildings\, interacting with NPCs etc.The controls on the other hand are not the best\, but I'm not sure if that's Rockstar's fault. To me it seems the controller doesn't have enough buttons\, R2 is both aiming and interacting with an NPC\, and R1 is both swapping between stuff to interact with or taking cover\, which can be annoying at times. It would've worked great on a keyboard obviously. I hope the PS5's controller will get an upgrade in terms of buttons. Movement is a bit clunky but that didn't bother me too much\, I get used to it pretty fast.Rockstar's RDR2 lived up to my expectations and brought even more. I really enjoyed the game. I started my second playthrough today and I'm going for 100% completion. It will take a while because there's so much to do\, which is great.

Every moment in Red Dead is a picture and it's really easy to lose yourselfUsually\, I never give art in any medium a perfect score. But Red Dead Redemption 2 is gaming at its finest\, and is likely one of the strongest contenders against the idea that \""video games are not art.\""From it's striking visuals of the barren wastelands of the west\, to the vivid landscapes of the swampy south. Every moment in Red Dead is a picture and it's really easy to lose yourself just looking at the scenery. While I won't call this a perfect game; no game is perfect. There's a lot to love.-- Story --As it should be known by now\, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel to RDR\, where we follow protagonist Arthur Morgan during the downfall of Van der Linde Dutch's gang during America's transition into the industrial age. The setting itself provides the conflict\, in that the outlaw -- the romantic ideal of a rough gunslinger ruling by the law of a gun -- is being snuffed out.I don't want to spoil the game\, but I have to note that it is powerful. We know where the characters are and where they are going to go because of the previous game. That inevitability is a constant reminder to the player\, and while you may know it\, it haunts you. But what I really love about this game\, is that as Arthur Morgan\, you feel like you're fighting a unwinnable war to remain free. And it really doesn't matter if you win\, you just want to be free.-- Characters --A lot of the older characters\, characters like Dutch\, Bill Williamson\, and John Marston\, are almost put second seat to the newest additions. We get to see a lot of the people that made up Dutch's 'infamous' gang. And these characters almost come to life. Rockstar did an amazing job breathing personality into them\, and through the conversations they have with Arthur and the other people in the camp\, you slowly get attached to them.But the character that steals the show is likely the protagonist\, Arthur Morgan. There is a Don Draper- esque quality to this character. He is depressed and hyper-aware of his life. Cynical and caring. What matters to him more than his own life and even money itself\, is his gang. He becomes such a sympathetic character because of what he wants\, which is to remain with his family of outlaws.-- Gameplay --The gameplay is alright. It's okay. There's not much to write about it. You ride on a horse for most of the game. You shoot people\, and sometimes use an ability to slow down time to line up your shots. This isn't anything new from Rockstar gaming. But that's okay. In frankness\, the gameplay serves as a supplementary addition to let people immerse themselves in the gameplay. And if I were to be honest\, it really does. I spent countless hours just hunting cougars\, bears\, deer\, and other animals just because it was so easy to lose yourself.What I really love about the Red Dead series is that while you're not playing a voiceless protagonist like games like Skyrim\, you can still really lose yourself and become a character from a hundred years past.-- Side Missions --The side missions are very near the Witcher 3 quality of story telling. While I won't lie and say they are pulitzer prize winning short-stories\, which they aren't. They are incredibly entertaining to the point where you actively purse them and not like in other games where they are pointless fetch quests.For example\, there's one quest where you find beheaded and decorated bodies all across the map. You have to find multiple pieces of clues to pinpoint the serial-killer and eventually turn him into justice. Rockstar took their time putting some variety and quality in these stranger missions.-- Visuals --The visuals are good. The details are amazing. As an avid PC gamer\, I am hard pressed to find something that matches the quality of this open world game. My only fault is the limitation of the hardware\, which forces the game to remain at 30 FPS. But then again\, if this were on PC\, it likely be difficult to get it to 60 fps without lowering some settings.-- Conclusion --The game is good. And I wrote too much. If you like the old west and losing yourself in an epic story then pick up a copy and have a blast.… Expand",True,,,,,,

Arthur huddles during a gust of cold wind and rubs his hands when walking by a fire. The story is interesting and the world around you feels alive as it reacts and changes to your choices. Bounty missions are more then just riding to the dot and killing everyone and are unique side stories all on their own. You aren't a cowboy terminator carrying 50 different guns on you. You need to prepare food and tonics\, maintain your weapons\, and survive in this harsh landscape. Your horse won't magically appear wherever you are and you can't store 500lbs of fur and supplies on your horse. You will have to make decisions based on what you really need and I love that feeling. The slow pace isn't boring its just methodical. I really got into the game as I climbed a mountain hunting a retired gunslinger\, changed into my winter coat so my health wouldn't lower as the snow fell and took a moment to lite a cigarette to increase my dead eye while i wiped my rifle down with oil. Made sure my horse was fed and considered setting up camp to craft some special ammo in case things went downhill.The BadThe immense immersion can sometimes be a chore. Crafting items for a specific task is great but doing it one at a time is not as much. The controls in gun combat feel wonky. Lowering the dead space and increasing the aim sensitivity seems to of fixed this issue for me. The Wanted system will probably get a patch as some strange things can cause you to be wanted. The most blaring example is two guys in a fight and one was knocked out. On accident I picked up the knocked out guy and promptly set him down again. This triggered a witness to report me for assault. Its a very sensitive system. The honor system can also be wonky as many users\, myself included\, have reported killing in self defense triggering a lower honor event and sometimes also a wanted status. The story explains this a little later but at first its seems blatanty contradictory to be an outlaw that reminds people \""I'm not a good man\"" but is constantly trying to raise your honor by doing good deeds and avoiding bad ones.Conclusion.I would not give this game a 10/10 as the wanted system and honor system both come across as buggy at times and these are important mechanics to the gameplay. The style\, story\, and detail make up for these occasional issues. The level of detail in the survival aspect feels more like a western outlaw RPG then a Rockstar game. How you feel about that just depends on your taste. If you love immersive RPG's or the red dead series this is a no brain buy. If you're on the fence it might be worth it to wait for a couple more patches to fix the various bugs and possibly rework the wanted and honor system.… Expand",True,0.25462922,0.017997624,0.061130337,0.06372428,0.18786818,0.13815513

There are glitches that have caused me to get wanted while not being in the area or having my guns vanish when i load into my game for the first time that day. Despite this and the complaints saying they dont want to have to eat or hate riding their horse\, its a good game\, its the wild west\, what did you expect to ride? Duels are not at all explained so be careful when entering one\, your horse can die easily if you dont take care of it\, and dont trust your bandanna to keep your identity safe\, wear the full head mask if you can. Animal conditions are not explained at all and sometimes feel like they are stacked against you as even the best shot may not yield a good pelt. A bit repetitive but this does feel immersive\, the upkeep is annoying but it adds to the atmosphere. I got this game and spiderman within a week of each-other and i have to say that i am enjoying Red Dead Redemption 2 way more\, the graphics\, game-play and tone all come together to provide an enjoyable experience.Obviously some patches are needed and im sure they will come\, the online being delayed gives people time to enjoy the single player so dont be put off by the lack of it. Alot of activities and npc's are locked behind missions but traveling the world in chapter 2 will still feel worth while. If you are trying to pick between Spiderman\, ACO\, and RDR2\, go for RDR2.(I also own ACO but its basically an origins DLC).… Expand",True,0.13041082,0.0064849854,0.009693438,0.031036375,0.07320584,0.030278467
78244,RDR2,2018-10-30,10.0,"I have played for over 50 hours by now and I must say\, this is by far one of the best gaming experiences I had in years. As a fan of the original Red Dead and the open world genre\, I came into this game with a lot of expectations and I must say\, my expectations were still blown away. The game does however have a few cons which I will start with.For starters\, the game at times feelsI have played for over 50 hours by now and I must say\, this is by far one of the best gaming experiences I had in years. As a fan of the original Red Dead and the open world genre\, I came into this game with a lot of expectations and I must say\, my expectations were still blown away. The game does however have a few cons which I will start with.For starters\, the game at times feels unresponsive\, as if your controls aren't really doing anything\, and it can take you out of the immersion for a moment. Second\, the survival aspect is a bit of a chore at first but at some point you get used to it and it becomes enjoyable\, the only thing that annoys me about it is how quickly the quality of your weapons can degrade\, it seems as if your gun can go from perfect condition to nearly broken in just one firefight. Aiming can also sometimes be rather clunky.There is one complaint I see a lot and it's that the game is slow\, this was done intentionally. The game FEELS like a western\, it feels immersive\, not fast paced like a modern game such as Grand Theft Auto\, I personally love the pace and feel like it fits perfectly. But it's not incredibly slow like some of these reviewers are making it seem to be\, it's still a rather fast game.Now for the pros.This game is a graphical marvel\, I have honestly never seen such a good looking open world game on console\, every little thing blows me away. The lighting is just perfect and god\, I get overwhelmed just thinking about it. Gameplay is also fantastic\, despite being clunky sometimes\, gun play is awesome and  can sometimes make you feel like you're in real danger\, fights are realistic and will force you to think things through instead of shooting aimlessly. Horse controls are perfect\, every horse is unique and delivers a different experience\, the bonding progress is also one I found enjoyable. Exploring whilst on horseback is just great\, sometimes you'll find an amazing view and you'll have to stop for a moment and just say wow. And voice acting? I have never seen a game where every single character\, including small NPCs have amazing voice acting like this\, it blows me away. On the point of voice acting\, let me talk about the story.The first half of the story is rather slow\, you get introduced to the characters but your actions feel like they don't have any heavy toll\, however\, this does change a lot towards the middle of the story. The second half of chapter 4 is when things really start to pick up and things start going wrong for the gang and all you can do is sit and ask \""what's going to happen next???\"" and force yourself to play more to find out. The way character's change through the story is fantastic\, just purely fantastic. An example that shouldn't be too spoilery due to the first Red Dead is Dutch's character. At the start of the game he is a smart\, respectable and sensible man\, he's an outlaw with a code and at times is a character that you as the player will even look up to. However\, a particular event in the middle of the story\, we see that change. Dutch becomes violent\, he abandons his code\, he does things that put the gang at risk for no particular reason\, we see Dutch transform into who he is in the original Red Dead\, including the whole natives part\, we can see how that came intro fruition. He's not the only character that shows a lot of change however. Just to drop a few names of fantastically written characters: Arthur\, Dutch\, Sadie\, Micah\, Rev Swanson\, Molly (despite her rather small role). I wouldn't say that so far John is the best written character\, but his voice acting is fantastic and it feels good to see him again.In conclusion\, this game is truly something else\, and if it weren't for really small technical flaws\, this game would be perfect. I can say though that this is now by far my favorite game and definitely deserves GOTY. Well done Rockstar on another amazIng title!… Expand",True,0.055274166,0.0038337708,0.017063495,0.02103047,0.06044999,0.018019408

This game was actually realistic and I felt that it really caught women's struggles to vote at the time which is a history setting of the game. However the problems I have with this game are the bugs that I am sure can be fixed but a problem I kinda do have that isn't much of a problem is the fact that the map is so big and to ride on a horse it can take up to a long time to get from point a to point b\, but however it's pretty nice to have a big map and I felt this game really did bring back more than Red Dead Redemption I think it did improve from the last game.

It presents the player with a world that is more alive than anything before it. A world with it's own laws (both physics and social)\, which are so deeply integrated into the moment-to-moment game play\, that you're eventually funneled into experiencing the game differently from how we have been playing these types of games for the past decade or so (with utter disregard for the game world\, it's environments\, and it's inhabitants). And some people are just not ready for such change.In RDR 2\, not only must you be aware of behaving \""realistically\"" according to the environment's variables (crowded town vs hunting grounds)\, you are also tasked with making sure Arthur's needs are met\, which goes from shaving and brewing your own coffee in the morning\, to eating enough throughout the day\, and properly resting at night to recover some much needed stamina. Taking a bath after a hectic gunfight also goes a long way into being more socially liked in-game. And don't even get me started with the care-taking of your horse and the relationship you can develop with it if you become a proper master! Brushing\, feeding\, patting\, and even removing the horses' seat wins you points with your steed. These are all drastic changes and a shift into the realms of simulation\, a shift most of us were unprepared for\, but one I now welcome with open arms.I must say though that at the very beginning I was kind of taken aback with this new direction. But as I stuck with it\, I realized I had started to really enjoy all of these sim-like mechanics. They may sound boring on paper\, but if you just go with the flow\, without wishing for the game to be something different\, you might just start to realize the game's true genius. RDR 2 allows you to live out your most detailed cowboy fantasies\, while also being the closest thing to a fully realized world we've seen in a game\, and it provides a spectacular experience.As a matter of fact\, all of these sim-like mechanics serve one purpose alone; to immerse the player in it's world in a deliberate and gradual manner\, and it does so at it's own pace until you eventually give in. After a few chapters\, I realized all these little tasks \, when combined with the amazing story\, breathtaking visuals\, superb soundscape\, and truly amazing animation\, fuse to create an experience that is not of this gaming generation\, but a solid first step into the next one. If there is one gripe I have\, is the actual gun combat. The cover-based peek and shoot style is in dire need of revision for future iterations. There is nothing wrong with the system as is\, it simply needs to evolve. We've played this shooting in other games before. It feels kinda old.I couldn't be happier to see the days of Ubi-open-world icon hunting fests finally come to an end.

78373,RDR2,2018-12-06,6.0,"Red Dead Redemption 2 has big shoes to fill. The original marked a genre defining moment in gaming. Open world games were common\, but not as mainstream as they are today. But Western games were-and still are-largely uncommon and unpopular. Rockstar mixed people’s fond memories of Spagetti Westerns with the blossoming open world genre\, and a handsome love child emerged. RD2 couldn’t repeatRed Dead Redemption 2 has big shoes to fill. The original marked a genre defining moment in gaming. Open world games were common\, but not as mainstream as they are today. But Western games were-and still are-largely uncommon and unpopular. Rockstar mixed people’s fond memories of Spagetti Westerns with the blossoming open world genre\, and a handsome love child emerged. RD2 couldn’t repeat that. The main question everyone has: Did RD2 improve upon its predecessor? The answer: Absolutely not. RD2 is OK in short bursts. But it isn’t pulling gamers in like the original for several key reasons.Graphically RD2 is average. RD2 doesn’t look any better than GTA V\, its cousin that launched 5 years earlier. Rockstar doesn’t push the boundaries on graphics or performance. Character animations are jerky and galloping horses look hilariously stiff. Collision detection is comical. RD2 is noticeably sluggish because of the 30fps lock. Frames can dip below 20fps when riding horses and walking thru towns. Those jarring experiences ruin the immersion. There’s no reason the PS4 Pro can’t push 60 or even 45fps. A big part of the performance problem stems from RD2’s garbage HDR implementation. Disabling that speeds things up a bit\, but not enough. I won’t even discuss the unacceptably long load times.The controls suck. They’re a bigger problem than RD2’s lackluster performance. Rockstar still hasn’t made efforts to streamline in-game menus or create modern\, accessible control schemes. Its games have the most unintuitive\, antagonistic\, and inconsistent controls among triple-A releases. Some actions require players press “O” while other similar actions require players hit “X”. And these “Hold X to pay respects” moments pop up all the time. Players can open and close dresser drawers\, but they can't close doors. Controls are laggy too.RD2 contains character statistics that aren’t clearly explained and virtually meaningless. In-game information such as plant/animal facts are buried behind multiple submenus. There isn’t a quick\, streamlined process to view journal entries\, review quests\, or anything else. The awful sluggish\, controls and antagonistic UI elements hinder players’ control and understanding of the RD2 world.And it’s all compounded by the relatively boring story that doesn’t throw enough carrots at players to keep them hooked. Other than running around or soaking up damage to build up stamina and health “cores”\, character progression is nonexistent. Quests don’t offer interesting rewards. Players are expected to complete the story for its own sake. That’s not enough these days. RD2 doesn’t provide enough guidance regarding crafting\, eating\, sleeping and other mechanics for players to care about them. But that doesn’t matter since all those systems are half-baked anyway. According to a recent article\, only 40% of players actually made it to the half-way point a month after RD2 launched. That's surprisingly low. Even less will finish the game. For a story driven experience\, that’s low.Considering how much time players spend doing nothing\, I’m surprised 30% made it that far. In missions\, characters spend a lot of time trotting from point A to B while talking. Or players will spend a lot of time galloping after people while mashing “X” until their thumbs bleed. Once at point B\, there’s the obligatory brawl or firefight. Rinse and repeat. Missions are an on rails experiences with one 1 path and 1 outcome apiece.Actions determine if your character is honorable or dishonorable\, but the implementation is just odd. Killing a man in a duel is OK and encouraged in certain situations. In fact\, the story forces players to shoot lawmen and farmers without penalty. But shooting a chicken is dishonorable. Chasing down a man and threatening him into silence after he witnessed your crime is perfectly OK as well. Yet\, looting an unconscious person is dishonorable. And honor is affected even if no one is around. That’s right. Committing acts in complete secrecy mystically affect honor. Honor affects things like prices of goods\, but there’s no reason to favor one path over the other.Despite all the people roaming about\, interactions are limited and samey. Even fellow outlaws hanging around the campsite are boring and shallow. Conversations are sparse. There’s essentially no reason to do anything. None. RD2’s world isn’t dynamic enough and its rewards too small for players to get wrapped up in the story or quests.RD2 is an unexpected disappointed. Other than the cinematic sequences and large open world\, RD2 misses the mark on everything. There’s literally nothing it does well\, but critics and fans are forgiving Rockstar because well\, it’s Rockstar. At least RD2 works...  However\, it commits the unforgiveable sin of being boring. Dreadfully so. Rockstar is stuck in past\, a spoonful of bitter irony given RD2’s setting.… Expand",True,0.11140333,0.00705719,0.0233943,0.028502205,0.0741757,0.025789235

Animals\, NPCs\, everything feels consistent and coherent. They all have a purpose\, never there for placeholding or to make it feel like there is something going on but not really\, like it usually happens with massive open world universes. Rockstar made an universe of their own and it shines.As we all know\, a game is not only made of big and living maps. It needs objectives\, a storyline\, strong characters and something to get you hooked on. Luckily enough\, RDR 2's story is nearly as perfect as the universe it takes place. You will fall in love with Dutch Van der Linde's gang\, and you will also hate them\, at times. It's unpredictable\, cruel and sometimes funny.

It's like that expensive Danish Cookies box you got for Christmas\, except you can't really have more of it once it's over. Unless one could wipe his memories and play it again like it was the very first time.And not only it's a good storyline\, but it also sticks with you. It's rather memorable\, with lots of ups and downs and unexpected twists. Truly one of the best stories ever written for a game\, despite some saying otherwise. Let's just say those are used to the standard AAA storytelling technique\, which is sort of predictable at all times. RDR 2's story might be everything\, but not predictable. If you have never gotten any spoilers\, the outcome of the campaign will be definitely a surprise. And it's better that way. Predictability takes a lot away from the overall enjoyment.Rockstar took full advantage of the \""next generation\"" of consoles - or should we say \""soon to be obsolete\"" generation? - delivering an impressive visual quality tied to a huge environment and excellent artificial intelligence. Just like in 2013 with Grand Theft Auto V on PS3 and X360\, the game is quite a closure to the current generation. Xbox One and PS4 are soon to be gone\, but they are going with a bang. Full style\, like a true gunslinger. A decent goodbye. The Housers once again proving that they master the extremely challenging task of taking the full potential of the hardware they got to work on\, like making juice out of rocks. With that much money to spare\, it is definitely not unexpected.It's a 10 from me\, but it definitely does not mean that it's perfect. There's no such thing as perfection. Everything has its flaws and RDR 2 could not run away from that\, but those are minor and don't affect the overall experience. It's definitely worth the 60 dollars and it's a life you have to live. Arthur Morgan's journey is one of a kind.… Expand",True,0.104795754,0.008163452,0.023595277,0.025284592,0.075792134,0.031314444

78410,RDR2,2018-11-07,9.0,"These are just my personal thoughts on the game.From start to finish this story of Red Dead Redemption 2 slowly works at almost masterfully telling not just Arthur's journey\, but that of each member of the gang. I say “almost masterfully” due to the fact that some of the character's development can be missed if the player decides not to engage with each member frequently. And this tooThese are just my personal thoughts on the game.From start to finish this story of Red Dead Redemption 2 slowly works at almost masterfully telling not just Arthur's journey\, but that of each member of the gang. I say “almost masterfully” due to the fact that some of the character's development can be missed if the player decides not to engage with each member frequently. And this too has its own narrative aspects\, ignore the gang too often\, and they grow to dislike you. In my playthrough\, I took every chance I could to engage each member\, and with that… very seldom have I played a game where each character feels so genuine\, unique\, fully fleshed out\, and alive. That doesn’t mean that everyone will like it\, and not everyone does\, but for me the slower pacing and build up really helps aid the narrative. Nothing feels too rushed or too forced\, characters seem to react according to their personalities and perceptions\, and when dealing with such a large cast that is a difficult thing to achieve. Although Rockstar's writers have attempted to curb a lot of their typical humor in favor of writing a compelling narrative\, there is still plenty of humor to be found in the world\, and it would seem to me that the dialogue finds itself to be much more authentically funny and realistic than some previous Rockstar titles.Personally\, this game thrives on the mundane... and I think that's kind of the point. Things like taking a bath\, resting at camp\, going fishing\, hunting\, playing cards\, dominos\, or just chatting by the fire. All of these little things help establish a world that allows you to be human\, to settle in and enjoy yourself\, to relax before the inevitable gunfight or the long rides across an open wilderness full of threats and adventure. After catching Arthur up on some much needed rest after taking on a few chores and missions at the gang camp\, I remember riding out into the forest to go hunting\, only to find that I was the one being hunted by a cougar. Before I knew it\, my trek to obtain meat for sustenance became a life or death situation when I realized that there was also a pack of wolves nearby who had come for the cougar's carcass. Stories aside from the narrative in RDR2 are plentiful and often... and they often have consequences and rewards. Spend too much time out in the wild without setting up a camp to eat and recover\, and Arthur becomes drained of energy\, which alters how he's able to hunt and fight. Neglecting food and Arthurs health deteriorates faster\, rely on Dead Eye for too long and his ability is drained making gunfights and precision hunting more skill dependent. The introduction of cores to these elements was daunting at first\, but as I continued through the game\, I came to appreciate them and understand their purpose. Seldom was it that I found myself sitting at the other end of the controller not having a great time. Random events occur pretty frequently and include Ambushes\, robberies\, bounties\, kidnappings\, prisoner transports\, and others and are fairly abundant.I did\, however\, encounter some technical and graphical issues. Things such as when mounting a horse near certain objects causing the animations to bug-out\, I was unable to loot certain bodies after a gunfight if they were near other interactable objects (like weapons\, tonics\, and the like\, where the solution was to move the body)\, and some texture pop-ins when riding really fast through densely forested/populated areas\, but otherwise I had very few issues with the game. All things considered though\, these issues were not game breaking and were honestly not surprising given how extensive this game truly is. I have tried to find any real major faults with the game from my personal perspective and honestly the positives far outweigh any negative in my book. And I do understand that the slower pacing will dampen some people's experience in the world of RDR2\, but as I stated earlier\, I found that aspect of it to actually aid the narrative and overall theme the game is attempting to establish.… Expand",True,0.091913216,0.004463196,0.026408968,0.025155678,0.066963166,0.02682521

You can take stagecoaches or trains in towns if you'd rather travel quickly\, and again contrary to what people are saying on here\, there IS a fast travel option (you just need to unlock it).The 'chores' such as maintaining health via eating really aren't tedious as people are making out either. You need to eat maybe every 20/30 minutes if that\, and all the stats such as stamina and health are improved over time.I won't lie\, the controls can be a bit fiddly and took some practice. I actually understand the criticism here\, but it's a simply a case of getting used to the controls. 10 hours in and they're as natural to me as any other game.Quite simply if you loved the first game\, then you're probably going to love this.

Starting with the story. The story missions\, in my opinion\, are the best I have ever played within an open world game\, all of them are very unique and there isn't much repetition at all. Due to you being in a large gang\, Rockstar has given every gang member a story of their own which almost feels like I'm not even playing one single story campaign\, but several\, where I can listen to each individual gang members story to see what all of them have experienced. The story missions vary from action-packed robberies to tense stealth missions and much more. The open world aspect is an absolute masterpiece\, the world in which you play in is neither too large nor too small\, just perfect size and all of the activities you can get up to in free roam are things which no other open world game has included\, like holding up a train by placing a stagecoach in front of it and then standing on top of it to wait for it to stop\, a similar thing was included in a scene from the movie 'The Assassination of Jesse James'. Things like this just immerse you even more due to it being a wild west game. For once\, even GTA V couldn't allow me to experience just admiring the view of the world which you are free to explore. Almost all open world game developers go on about how they can just 'admire the gorgeous view of the world' if you become bored\, but in my opinion\, that has never happened. Ironically\, the only game that has come close to that is the first Red Dead Redemption. Obviously\, I am not able to waffle on about all of the things you can do in this game but one last thing I wanted to discuss is the controversial topics which are openly (and without hesitance) included in the game. Topics like racism and sexism which were very prevalent in 1899 (the time which this game is set in) I am not going to spoil any of the story but there are some things which blown me away with amazement and shock. Instead\, I will give you a few examples of which I found in free roam\, I was browsing around a big city which you end up in around about halfway through the story and found a woman who was advocating for women's rights to vote (which was a big thing in this time era)\, another example I found which may be a little more offensive to some people\, I was walking through the town of Rhodes (which is known for a higher populace of African Americans) in free roam when I saw these white men harassing this black guy (if I remember correctly they were robbing him at the back of the saloon.) and I actually heard one of the white men say \""if you don't give up your things now darkie you're gonna receive a bullet in your skull.\"" As i heard this i was blown away with immediate shock! I've only heard things like that (and very rarely) in movies! Cleary this is not something which I would personally hold up to a game developers neck and demand them to include something like this in their game\, but it is just inexplicable how Rockstar have done something like this.I also hear people waffle on about the shooting and combat system\, even though the combat can become a little frustrating at times due to the cover system being changed\, I can tell you that the shooting is once again the best within any game. No longer am I just gliding through mission after mission\, blasting everything i see with one bullet and killing everyone in 20 seconds. I now have to control the recoil of my weapon and where I am shooting\, I now have to utilize my weapons correctly for the right situations as compared to something like GTA V where I could use the weakest pistol in the game and still glide right through everyone. This is the sort of realism which for some reason puts a lot of people off\, but I am in love with it\, when I kill someone in RDR 2 it actually feels like I have blasted a bullet right through someone's face (which I have)\, where many games cannot seem to do this.

Largely this is due to the time\, resources\, and talent that R* had in development.

If you're like me\, having played and loved the first game extensively\, this prequel game improves upon that in almost every imaginable way.  Largely this is due to the time\, resources\, and talent that R* had in development.  If you never played RDR1 but have hundreds of hours in GTA V\, you might see some aspects of the gameplay here as comparatively negative.RDR2 was designed to be a slow burn game.  I've been reading that statement a lot before and since first playing but it really is true.  The authenticity to the era is unwavering.  Travel by horse is often required and is often very long.  There is no radio to listen to along the way.  Even the fastest horses still feel slow compared to most vehicles in GTA V.  But that is the point.  The game wants you to savor the moment\, breath things in and perhaps contemplate a little more than you would in other games.  Even on foot\, exploring the world is deliberately paced.  I would go so far as to call the controls sluggish at points.  Arthur moves with a certain weightiness in the world that makes things feel very grounded\, almost a little too much for a videogame.  There are specific and realistic animations for just about every single action Arthur does\, from grabbing a can of coffee off a shelf\, to roasting meat over a fire\, to looting bodies\, to cocking his revolver before each shot.  There's no way to skip these things\, no real shortcuts to watching his actions play out.  At times things can seem like a slog\, but that is commitment to the feel R* was going for.For some perspective\, I'm still in the 2nd chapter and have done several side missions and random encounters.  I've probably got 15 hours with the game and even that still feels like scratching the surface.  I know there are many things I've yet to encounter based on all the hype and previews leading up to release\, but I know there are many unknown features also.  That is exciting.Obviously the game is stunning looking.  I'm just playing on my regular PS4 on a Panasonic plasma from 2013\, but it still blows me away.  I would love to play on upgraded gear\, but honestly that won't affect most people's enjoyment level with the game as the core experience is the same across all platforms.  The audio is very dynamic and impactful.  Voice acting is superb.The story is grounded and exciting so far.  I'm looking forward to seeing how things play out.  Til I finish it I can't say too much about it really\, other than the cast of characters is top notch.The menu system is a bit convoluted\, but I've come to the conclusion that no modern game is going to have an excellent menu system that can manage everything flawlessly.  It works\, could be better though.  The map is really a sore spot for me.  It's slow and the icons are too small and almost all look the same.  You have to zoom way in or out and it's cumbersome at best.  Using the map on the companion app on my tablet has been a big help in that regard.  It's pretty cool because it updates in real time based on the actual game map and you can set waypoints more quickly.  I recommend using it just for that if nothing else.Gunplay and other activities are solid and there are many options for tweaking how easy or challenging you want the aiming\, HUD and various other gameplay aspects to be.  The physics are sometimes hilarious\, but most of the time extremely realistic\, especially when you upgrade your horse bonding and can start pulling off the GTA equivalent of drifting and handbrake maneuvers.It's very easy to get overwhelmed in a game of this size and scope.  Sometimes I have to remind myself of what I was originally trying to accomplish\, before I got sidetracked by any number of sights and sounds along my route or an even greater number of RPG style mechanics.  Many things can be outright ignored\, but more often than not it feels counter intuitive to do that.  That is a credit to the world R* has created.  RDR2 begs you to explore just a little longer and a little farther each time you jump back in.No game of this scope is ever going to be ''perfect'' and objectively there are some issues here\, but taken as a whole this is still a landmark game in my opinion and will be a front runner along w/ God of War for 2018's GOTY.… Expand",True,0.05651112,0.0033569336,0.01087737,0.019032324,0.054437835,0.009230154

78571,RDR2,2018-11-01,8.0,"This game series will always be a classic and a series that you cant point to to show that rockstar is a great studio. I loved the story\, the very slow pace was enjoyable for me. I loved watching Dutch go from a man with a code who cares about his gang more than anything to the shell of a man we see him in RDR I thought that was performed very well. All the voice actors in this were great\, the graphics are the best i have seen since Uncharted 4\, truly set the bar. The world\, like GTA V\, feels alive and immersive\, let alone beautiful. The characters all felt like real people and this was down to the phenomenal writing.Now Some of the Negatives- Slow Prologue (Not too bad but a bit too limiting)- Sometimes allows too much freedom. (I felt like you didnt need to do anything to get through missions easily and many redundant features such as upgrades for satchel and talismans.)- No cool GTA style heist planning sequences (you kind of just have one set up mission then you do it.) [DISCLOSURE] I think they will remedy this in Online Multiplayer.- Arthur Morgans Death: we have already played a game with john that lasted about 15 - 20 hours. I had just saved up enough money to go on a guns and clothing spending spree and then it killed him off\, i don't feel like everyone of these games need to do that to have an emotional effect on the player.- Not enough time for \""white Missions\"" these come and go to quickly.- camp updates are fairly redundant\, the only useful one was fast travel and horse station.I know these negatives are very nitpicky but these sometimes major gameplay points that are executed in the wrong way do not allow me to give it a ten. If you are looking for an amazing immersive game to play over a week or two be sure to pick up red dead redemption two but i would understand waiting for price drop.

Though I do agree that it may not be fanciful to everybody that played it. For me I think it felt purposeful for the type of game it is trying to be. It's mainly due to the fact that each weapon has almost an entirely different feel. There's a certain weight to the combat and shooting due to this that other games have not yet explored. This type of gunplay has not been done before in any game\, so I wouldn't blame people for disliking the slow paced\, cinematic style Rockstar was aiming for. It does need time to get used to it\, it's probably due to common gameplay expectations to come with these sorts of shooting games. It's not a secret Rockstar is a company of experimentation and innovations\, it's also clear that their intention was to reinvent 3rd person shooting with a more grounded style of gameplay requiring precise movements and strategy that blends in with their animations. It's more than meets the eye and I just can't help but wonder how many look past all this. Knowing Rockstar as the richest gaming developer in our modern world with 8 years on this game\, you would think that there would be a reason behind the gameplay mechanics and decisions in the final outcome. Sad to see that this is underappreciated because of how casual many games have been that fixed our expectations on good shooting mechanics.I have yet to finish the story and this was my overall experience with the game so far.

78679,RDR2,2018-10-27,8.0,"This game is an amazing piece of work.  The attention to detail and nuance is awe inspiring\, for a video game.  The story and character development walk the line very well between providing original and engaging tales and people\, while providing nods to both pop culture / spaghetti western entertainment interpretation of the cowboy era... and some of the hard truths about it.As a gameThis game is an amazing piece of work.  The attention to detail and nuance is awe inspiring\, for a video game.  The story and character development walk the line very well between providing original and engaging tales and people\, while providing nods to both pop culture / spaghetti western entertainment interpretation of the cowboy era... and some of the hard truths about it.As a game though\, RDR2 is not a perfect game.  It isn't a 10 out of 10\, a 5/5\, a 100% or such.  Playing the game itself\, is where flaws show their ugly faces.Weapon equipping seems to have taken an odd step backward to the 'Halo' mentality\, where you have a set number of holster slots you can field.  I'm actually mostly alright with this.  It's what happens when you interact with your horse\, that there is a problem.  Your longarm slots just plain depopulate.  So\, any time you get on your horse and plan to get off\, you really need to check your weapon wheel to make sure your longarms came with you.  Sometimes\, arbitrarily\, they do not.L1 is the button for readying / holstering your weapon.  Intuitively\, you would expect that whatever weapon you held last is what gets unholstered with L1.  In this game\, it's not only not the case\, it's nearly completely arbitrary what happens.  If you do absolutely nothing else from the last time you drew and holstered your weapon\, you'll draw the same gun\, whether it's a longarm or a handgun.  If you had a longarm used prior\, but you stop to loot a guy before engaging in combat again... you'll draw your pistol instead.  If you skin an animal\, you'll holster/unsheathe your knife\, not a gun.  If you carried something and dropped it or stowed it on your horse\, you'll unholster... your hands.  I am not sure what compelled the developer to not simply code the 'unholster' button to just default to 'whatever gun was intentionally picked last'\, but here we are.  L1 doesn't even have any particularly transforming behaviors depending on context\, like L2 or square or the rest.  This is frustrating and I can't see how anyone could justify this functionality as 'fun' or 'intended'.Every other game out there from the beginning of this generation uses either the options button or pressing the touchpad as either going to main menu\, or going to map.  The touchpad is commonly used for map.  The touchpad here instead changes camera distance.  I've been playing this game for two days now and i am still pressing the touchpad thinking 'map'.  I know long-press on options brings up the map\, but it still bothers me.  Not a big complaint\, but the choice to make the buttons function as such aren't intuitive.The cues for context button presses are reduced to this tiny indicator in the lower right.  I can understand they don't want to obstruct the visuals\, but at the same time\, what good are the visuals if you can't look directly at them because you have to watch out for a potential button to push that'll save your life\, prevent you from reloading?  The indicator should have been made a bit more ostensible.Difficulty in this game is weird.  You're nearly immortal\, so long as you can take cover.  Step out of cover though and you may as well have stepped in the direct path of every bullet on earth.  A hostile finds you out in the open?  One or two guys can be manageable\, but anything in excess of that\, especially when it seems like they were warped in just outside of camera view to barrel down on you with horses that are absurdly fast\, you're dead before you can even touch off dead-eye.  Wolves will just tear out your throats with a one-shot\, and can take an entire cylinder dump from a revolver and still come at you if you don't hit them in the head.  Reloading sees you losing money and whatever skins / animals on your horse you haven't dropped off.  I wasn't expecting Dark Souls punishment to come along with a rather obnoxious spike in difficulty over my original RDR experience.Lastly\, the survival mechanics are much too tedious.  Having stamina\, health and deadeye being finite resources that you grow\, are expected parts of the game.  The 'cores'\, and worrying about having to drop to a submenu and eat a goddamn can of corn\, or peaches or something\, is just tedious.  Add to that\, having to wait *three days* between stew servings at camp?  Seriously?  I'm the dude on the ledger that's providing 2/3rds of the camp's income and logistical engineering leadership\, yet I'm entitled to a plate of stew every three days\, *and* the stats menu has the temerity to point out that i appear to be \""underweight\"".  The 'core' mechanics and tedium involved with keeping yourself fed\, are needless in a mostly cinematic action experience type game such as this.Summary\, RDR2 is a gorgeous game filled with amazing character\, attention to detail\, and horses that never stop pooping.  It is marred however by problems with the 'game' part of it\, that prevent it from being perfect.… Expand",True,0.029799197,0.0024318695,0.009101473,0.014884921,0.029888187,0.010783645

Full disclosure: the atmosphere is fantastic & definitely among this generation's elite. The gameplay itself isn't at the level I expected it to be. Movement is so stiff it gives me anxiety. The story pacing is slow and at times tedious.Tutorial info is flashed at you too quickly and at the worst moments\, except for info relating to firearms and horses since you learn those while actually using them. Little else is explained when it matters. To clarify: in the middle of a riding segment when I'm trying to focus on what people are saying or doing\, and watching where I am going\, suddenly up in the top left corner of the screen a tip flashes in small font and last like 2 seconds. Something about medicine that I have no use for right now\, what the hell did it say? I was too busy choosing dialogue options and avoiding running my wagon off the path to see it in time. This is NOT how you go about teaching people about mechanics.The gunplay is a joke.-If you're in cover you auto-aim perfectly every time you exit. You just popped out your head to see your target and are shooting at odd angles. Huh?-Out of cover you fight this bizarre jerky movement of the crosshair like your character has Parkinson's\, despite standing still and shooting at a flat angle to your target. Huh?-Anyone who thinks aim will be better with an upward/downward trajectory than a sight line perpendicular to the line of gravity knows nothing about ballistics or optics.How does any of this make sense at all? It's like they got their notes backwards. You have to exert so much effort to get off a clean shot when actually aiming than just leaving cover and mashing the fire button. This garbage makes no sense. I wouldn't be irritated if this game didn't espouse realism on mundane details like a horse's junk changing size based on temperature. But they couldn't do ballistics accurately?Now I'll get over the crappy gunplay because I still love the setting\, the voice acting\, and storyline events like gang fights and train robberies. I will wander around this world aimlessly for hours before finishing the storyline. The game truly is beautiful. That don't mean I think it is 10/10 or GOTY material.-Hair does not look great in this game and pales in comparison to the rest of the graphics.-The human models overall aren't great unless it is a cutscene.-Most of the game's graphics are 12/10\, then there are the few aspects that are 5/10. It should not be this inconsistent.The first time I shot a deer and stowed the corpse on my horse\, my jaw dropped at how realistic the dangling body looked. Then there's the hair graphics\, worse than The Witcher 3...a game that is over 3 years old.I have a love/hate relationship with Rockstar Games. They always get 95+ from major critic$ despite not being at that level at all just because of the developer's name. Then you have PC gamers who haven't even touched the game rating it a 0 because they can't play it. Both of these groups should be fired out of a cannon and into the sun.I do like Red Dead Redemption 2. It just isn't the GOTY trendsetter I hoped it would be. It seems to be doing too much following\, not enough leading\, and in some ways it's too far behind. It's a solid 8/10. God of War is the closest thing to a perfect game that we saw this year and the clear winner of GOTY.… Expand",True,0.10783285,0.0065612793,0.020279141,0.029053112,0.08904689,0.01940071

It introduces many new features and aspects that are a great additions to the game. You play as Arthur Morgan who is in the Dutch Van Der Lin gang who wants to cling on to his outlaw life but is in a world surrounded by increasing civilization. The game looks and sounds great from the sound design to the voice acting and the cutscenes shows the amount of effort that rockstar has put in this game. The cutscenes themself feel like you are watching a movie\, the even use elements that directors use in film. They use a bunch of non diegetic sound (sound the player can hear but not the actual characters) which gives the feeling of movies soundtrack playing at parts where the institute in the scene is building up\, so the scene is accompanied by high pitched stringed instruments that give the game an authentic feel. This game has a lot of new features that are great\, like the ability to customize your horses saddle and you horse having stats. Also the ability to clean/ admire your weapon. But then there are some features that feel like they couldn’t be added in like having eat and drink\, shave and feed and brush your horse\, it makes them game feel more like you have to chores then actually be an outlaw. But that’s the point\, Rockstar was trying to go for realism\, they wanted this to feel realstic\, that’s why you have to do these things so make feel like you are an outlaw in 1899. The missions feel repetitive and the constant horseback riding to point a to b makes for very slow mid game making chapter 3 forgettable. My closing statement about this game is that it’s great but not amazing. Just like any other game it has things it can improve on\, like the the sluggish horse movement\, the clunky controls and repetitive missions. But it also excels at being a game that is immersive and shows pride in how much work rockstar has put in this game.… Expand",True,0.085582085,0.0059890747,0.021987455,0.022964163,0.059948977,0.02492592
78712,RDR2,2018-11-15,10.0,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an action-adventure romp through a changing West which takes place at the turn of the 20th century\, and is a prequel to the previous title: Red Dead Redemption (PS3)\, story-wise; Another game which received near-perfect high scores from reviewers\, and with good reason.Story:\nYou play as Arthur Morgan\, an outlaw who's having to fight for survival in a worldRed Dead Redemption 2 is an action-adventure romp through a changing West which takes place at the turn of the 20th century\, and is a prequel to the previous title: Red Dead Redemption (PS3)\, story-wise; Another game which received near-perfect high scores from reviewers\, and with good reason.Story:You play as Arthur Morgan\, an outlaw who's having to fight for survival in a world where the Wild West becomes more and more tame with each passing day. Battling with wildlife\, gang-life\, and your own internal struggles of morality and mortality.Red Dead Redemption 2 does many things better than its predecessors\, and provides an experience you simply will not get anywhere else\, and with an online component released later this month\, I feel the need to give it a perfect 10.Gameplay:This game is superb in its delivery-- The world is rich with detail. The stakes feel high. The culture reflected in the game\, feels genuine (more often than not)\, and the questions of morality\, answered by the player's actions\, which is the heart of the protagonist's story-- truly felt pressuring at times\, as I found myself teetering between outlaw and cowboy-savior\, often.Sound:The soundtrack to the game is appropriate to the source material and does a good job of setting the mood dynamically. There aren't any tracks that have particularly jumped out at me as memorable\, but I don't think the music in the game seeks to be catchy\, it only seeks to set the stage.The sound design\, all the weapons\, interactions\, voice acting\, animal sounds\, etc. all feel genuine.Controls:The controls for this game may be complicated for some\, at first\, but are worth sticking with to learn everything your character is capable of doing.The lack of approachability may seem like a negative mark for some\, but I welcome the freedom in an open-world game.There are moments where the complex \""you can touch and loot everything\"" approach may hinder the player from easily interacting with an area with loot in it\, but again\, I would take the minor inconvenience of having to stand just right to pick up an item in a pile\, just to have the greater amount of freedom elsewhere.About negative reviews:I was very surprised to see that this game received (at the time of this review's writing) a sub-8 score.Negative reviews talk about how there's \""nothing to do\""-- or how the \""controls\"" are bad\, and \""feel like an afterthought\""\, but I strongly disagree.Like the game itself\, the controls are complex and completely contextual\, and a great deal of thought has gone into getting them right.This is both a pro and a con\, as it allows for a great range of player choice\, but also means that there's a bit of a learning curve for the player.Playing on the PS4 I have not run into any of the bugs some reviewers have come across\, but I don't doubt that there are bugs in the game-- it's absolutely massive.Closing statements:I really have enjoyed my time playing Red Dead Redemption 2. I have other friends who are playing through it as well\, and you know it's a special game when we always have a story to tell each other about our playthrough. Either something funny happened at the saloon\, or we ran into a plan gone afoul. It's fun to discuss and compare what choices we've taken at key moments\, and be excited to hear about them. (The last game that made me feel that way was Skyrim (2011)).Having played GTA Online for a while with some friends\, I honestly can't wait for Red Dead Online to be released\, because the only thing that would make this outlaw/cowboy open world experience better\, would be robbing trains with actual friends!10/10… Expand",True,0.09438288,0.0047683716,0.030433474,0.025929155,0.060951006,0.02803385

78772,RDR2,2018-11-06,10.0,"Generally speaking\, there are two types of negative reviews for RDR2.1. People annoyed about the game not being out for PC\, or upset about 30 fps.2. People who thinks that the game is too slow and repetitive.\n\nYou have to understand that it's deeply unfair to give a game a bad rating because it's not out for PC or has a frame cap that—frankly—most console games have. You gotta judgeGenerally speaking\, there are two types of negative reviews for RDR2.1. People annoyed about the game not being out for PC\, or upset about 30 fps.2. People who thinks that the game is too slow and repetitive.You have to understand that it's deeply unfair to give a game a bad rating because it's not out for PC or has a frame cap that—frankly—most console games have. You gotta judge the game based on its content\, narrative\, gameplay—by judging it on external factors such as fps or PC-availability you're severely hurting the reliability of its rating.If you're in the second demographic who thinks the game is too slow\, it's probably because you're used to playing fast-paced games. Rocket League\, God of War\, Fortnite\, etc.YES\, RDR2 is a slower game than the aforementioned\, but in that slowness is where you find its quality. Its slowness makes you notice the little things around you—the landscape\, animals\, birds\, the changing light. The slowness makes you appreciate the games atmosphere\, it makes you feel involved in its world. The fact that you have to ride on horseback to several quest-points is a deliberate choice from R* in getting you to know your fellow characters better through conversation while stressing the world's scale by having you travel the actual distances.Releasing a game like this is a very bold move by R* in a time where our attention-spans have become ridiculously short. I'm a firm believer that this approach is good and healthy for the gaming industry and for gamers\, demonstrating that games don't have to be over-the-top\, unrealistic and FAST in order to succeed. Maybe we can get back to a frame of mind that's not just about a quick fix.The pacing of the game will sadly throw some people off. These are people who have this shortened attention-span\, are unable to appreciate the beauty of the game-world and the game's excellent writing\, but who are interested in games that are more arcade-ish\, colourful and crazy. Having different preferences is totally fine. As an example\, I personally don't like to play Fortnite. Its art style is not for me and the gunfights too hectic. But that doesn't mean that I can't see its quality on a mechanical level. And just because I don't like this type of game myself\, doesn't mean I'm gonna give it a terrible review on Metacritic. It just means I won't review it. Similarly\, I think more people reviewing RDR2 ought to consider if it's even a game for them before reviewing it.Lastly\, I give the game a perfect score\, and I do so after much consideration and after having completed 58% of the game. I think it deserves a 10 because no other game has made me feel this much like I wasn't playing a game. The world looks lived in\, the NPC's feel human to an almost unsettling degree\, and my choices feel like they have impact. And the music is sensational. Sure\, the game has some glitches here and there\, you can't avoid that with an open world game. But if there ever was a game more deserving a perfect score\, it's Red Dead Redemption 2.… Expand",True,0.15987846,0.004634857,0.034042787,0.058475737,0.07740857,0.0103175985

I feel like it is no coincidence that the online was not available at release so the game can be rated on single player alone. I've spent a significant amount of time online now and the best way to describe the experience is probably simply 'bad' or 'not fun'. This is not because i'm bad at it\, if anything i think the showdowns are too easy... You point in someone's general direction\, you look slightly up to focus on their head\, you wait a second for the accuracy and you shoot\, rinse and repeat. It feels like they have not adapted the game for multiplayer\, they took the single player and copy pasted everything to online\, however\, this doesn't work. Once you do that\, the problems that existed in single player get amplified and there are tons of new problems that come from not properly adjusting the gameplay to be suitable for online.The progression online is slow\, too slow\, the idea that ammo is shared between showdown and free roam just forces you to spent your cash on ammo\, everything else is too expensive for the payout that you get and if they're slightly cheaper\, they don't feel like they're worth it. I have to admit that the co-operative missions are the most fun you can have online but traversing the map feels like a chore. There have been numerous bugs and glitches that I have come across and the terrain feels restrictive\, the smallest of hills forces you to go around for miles because you can't climb it. Deaths feel too quick and the cover system fails a lot of the times plus there's hardly any cover usually... In comparison\, GTA online had a few of these issues too but the game was leagues more fun than Red Dead\, the modernised feel works with that type of online whereas Red Dead is held back by it. Driving a car to your destination is a lot more fun than tapping a button over and over until your horse runs out of stamina in vast wilderness where there's hardly any people or anything else to distract you from the fact that you're just tapping a button for minutes on end.Overall\, the online experience simply does not work in my opinion\, the free roam\, showdown\, not even the free roam events\, the co-op missions is what is done right in online but they're few and far between.

It's definitely not for everyone\, but if you played the first game and were invested in the characters this game turns the writing\, storytelling\, drama etc. up to 11. This combined with the insane visuals and cinematography in cut-scenes meant that much of the time while playing this game I genuinely felt like I was watching a western movie.This is NOT a game you get if you want to play a fun action game. This is a game you get if you want to genuinely be immersed into a wild west experience. It's definitely not so focused on realism that it becomes unfun but it is much different than any Rockstar game I've ever played and is actually fairly comparable to a less clunky Kingdom Come Deliverance in terms of mechanics and the general feeling of the world.Also\, the world is insanely huge\, the story so far is fantastic and engaging\, and the epilogue is supposed to be revelatory (but I don't know what happens yet).

There's too much frustrating and superfluous detail which does nothing but stand in the way of the fun. The horse system is stupid. There's a crafting system that requires combinations of animal pelts but nowhere to store anything even though you have a large camp. So I ended up just selling my hard hunted perfect skins because I needed room... so I don't even know how the crafting of some high end kit would be even possible. The horse steals back all your rifles every time you sit on it so you always end up in fights with the wrong weapons in hand and if you try to sort out your weapons every time you get back on the horse (which is advisable) you end up pulling out a gun in an area where you shouldn't because it's impossible to even look at a weapon without it then being drawn. You push one button to draw a weapon but then you need another button press to raise the weapon and then another to actually open fire... at which point you realise that the horse stole back your guns and the reason your not firing back is that you're unarmed!This control scheme is obviously being kept so as to link with GTA 5 and allow players to go from one to another more smoothly. There's no way this scheme would ever have been chosen otherwise because it's simple unusable. There's even some things that are only comfortably achieved if you have three hands.I have struggled through about 20 hours now and have always ended my session in a rage quit because I'm always failing mission s or dying due to the game's overly complex system. In one case the horse stopped in front of a door I needed to go through. The horse will not move for you! So I placed the injured man I was rescuing on the ground so I could get back on the horse to move it away and suddenly the guy dies. Not only was this a mission fail but also for no reason everyone in town immediately assumed I had killed him and went for the lawmen. Not very realistic.Red Dead 2 is too busy wowing us with how detailed it is to remember that the gamer is looking for some fun and escapism... but here I am just waiting to make a hundred bullets one by one\, each with animation. Or waiting for my horse\, or waiting to get from A to B because the hopeless fast travel doesn't even do properly the little it tries to.

Why propose a world so vast without any plant really from gdr?The dead eye takes away all fun in the long run and the assisted aim is even worse. Can I take it off? sure\, if to aim was not an agony. Is it an agony because the PG is a beginner? Then I would stay there\, but this would mean that the pg evolves into experience and maybe at the level x is released dead eye and aim assist.Can you make me a sketchy temperature / clothing system?

No\, and for charity it should not be\, it's a video game.Then the world.Cross and delight.Never seen anything so beautiful. Never seen greater missed opportunity.The one mission philosophy for time is absurd for this scaffolding and\, even if we want to follow a strong narrative choice in which it is a story\, what I have to live\, not a narrative of mine\, is standing in a bad state.Already experienced many experiences in which the mission x that could be between point A and B of a principal (solitary or non-hyper narrative) can not be triggered because I have to do the mission chosen at the time and only that.Examples? I collect debts and I remember that on the path between one and the other there was a bounty. Can I do it to break and give better rhythm? No. On the contrary if I pass the npc that I will magically find there are not and will only spawn at completed debts mission.Or. I'm going to do a robbery to a diligence and in the path known an NPC asking for help. I approach. I can not interact. Is it more consistent with the fact that the mission is being carried out? Maybe. Is it fun / fulfilling? No.I was playing today again at TW3 for example. I'm carrying out a mission and in useful points the NPC in front of me always asked me the choice \""do you want to continue or come back later?\"". Or anyway I could leave the npc halfway also starting the following step and going to hunt a monster and then come back wanting. Those to the cd projekt are naive that do not think of certain dynamics? No\, on the contrary it is just thinking about the fun of the player who made the game flexible. At Rockstar they made a game for pure onanism\, emphasizing choices of gameplay because \""integrity\"" when they had to stand with their feet on the ground and think that the gamer must also have fun.And be clear\, sometimes with rdr2 I enjoy it. But at times.I eat my hands every single time open the map for example. I open and I see an exterminated and beautiful thing with ... one\, maximum two\, three counters. Why? What is it really for? Eight years and I do not have an Indian faction to do separate missions\, or a corrupt police faction or anything else to keep a varied rhythm? The old and buggy Skyrim had stupendous wizards\, thieves\, murderers line quest and the thing kept him more alive than ever.

And furthermore\, where to sell an item I have a receiver far from the other. Do you use trains\, stagecoaches or fast travels? All right\, but then we're admitting the damage.And the few missions?Two random.Secondary. Bounty hunt.Ride 10 minutes to Strawberry. A casual encounter of a woman in search of archaeological finds. Nothing special. I arrive and take the poster. Another 7 minutes on horseback. Dude in a cave. Shoot ralenty to disarm it. End of mission. Time of action. 40 seconds. Maybe.Primary. Robbery at home.10 minutes on horseback. Arrival and companion that suggests me diversion him and I sneak.

I also want you to remember my review when you are transported to the moon while walking through camp\, yes you can't run in your own camp\, you must walk slow\, a zero gravity slow  like Neil Armstrong on the moon. I hear his voice while walking through camp. \""That's one small step....\"" You are forced to walk back and fourth through camp like this to do tedious tasks such as shave\,Eat\, put money in a piggy bank\, help shop for groceries...every anointing task of your life is here\, i'm sure later there is a mission where you must wipe your crack clean. The missions are annoying things I want to skip over to get to the rest of the game...that doesn't exist. Enjoy driving a wagon\, you will be doing it for hours\, don't get you wagon stuck either\, your painful and I mean painfully slow wagon. Careful in town too\, if you accidentally bump into someone with the clunky controls the whole town may find you in contempt and shoot you too your death. Oh I almost forgot\, your hat falls off all the time\, if you play through the game you will spend hours on switching and swapping your hat\, i'm serious. The actual content of play makes me wonder if I would enjoy a game with a constant button sequence to press more than this. The realism is terrible too\, they actually show dead deer being hung on a gambrel without being gutted.  You ride with an ungutted deer 5 miles back to camp and start to butcher it without gutting it. I think the Devs must have lacked some real world experience to say the least. The hunting is a complete joke and waste of time. I also wish to condemn the horse riding itself as it is clunky and you hit something and go flying and have to pick up your hat before getting back on.I am a Rockstar fan boy\, I played GTA on ps1 as a teenager\, I love in depth games with expansive RPG characteristics like Final Fantasy\, Castlevania Symphony of the night\, Metroid\, Ogrebattle\, I love long games\, hard games. The days of Rockstar getting by on taboo subject matter and atmospheric bliss are over\, the games have changed again and this linear boorish style is not coming along.I'd rather play GUN for ps2 or Sunset riders for SNES\, Blood Brothers\, Gunsmoke for NES\,  I would much rather play the original GTA with Birdseye view than this. There are better games than this that came out this year like Mega Man 11\, Mega man X collection\, COD or the last few years\, XCOM\, Mario Odyssey. If you have played BOTW it renders this abomination unplayable. I think I will go play Castlevania for NES to wash this hideous taste out my mouth.(The struggle is the glory)… Expand",True,,,,,,

The story is over 60 hours long and incredibly daunting at first\, as is the massive\, sprawling open world this game offers after its 2-3 hour snow-filled prologue.(No Spoilers) I’ll begin by sharing myFirst\, I’d like to admit and embrace that Red Dead Redemption 2 is not for everyone\, the game takes itself very seriously and moves at an incredibly slow pace (to it’s advantage). The story is over 60 hours long and incredibly daunting at first\, as is the massive\, sprawling open world this game offers after its 2-3 hour snow-filled prologue.(No Spoilers) I’ll begin by sharing my thoughts on the story:Red Dead Redemption 2 begins in 1899\, The Grizzlies\, a snowy mountain range at the very top of the in-game world. After a botched robbery attempt\, the “Van Der Linde” gang led by Dutch Van Der Linde and his “Lead Enforcer” and Player Character\, Arthur Morgan\, have fled into The Grizzlies to escape the law. You are released from The Grizzlies after 2-3 hours of slow paced\, atmospheric linear gameplay and unleashed into the ginormous open world of Red Dead Redemption 2 as you and your gang move their camp down to horseshoe overlook\, the first real camp location.The story mainly revolves around the end of the “Wild West” and the beginning of the “Industrial Revolution”\, more specifically Dutch and his gang’s downfall\, even more specifically Dutch’s descent into madness himself and Arthur’s gruelling journey to find his place in the world\, find out who he is and where he belongs. It is a brutal and realistic tale full of twists\, turns\, surprises and sadness as you witness the inevitable fall of the gang. The storytelling is slow but effective\, the voice work is unimaginably convincing\, the cutscenes are beautifully animated and the exploration and mission quality is like nothing I’ve ever experienced before\, missions are unique and gameplay is extremely varied throughout the campaign\, you’ll go from shovelling manure\, building a fence or chopping wood to robbing banks\, hijacking trains or an intense firefight in a burning building as it collapses in on you. Full of variety.Secondly I’d like to briefly cover the side missions and random encounter’s;So far the side missions have come in two forms for me\, that of “Stranger Missions”\, multi-part quests with fully developed cutscenes and bounty hunting\, interesting and somewhat always unique mini-stories as you hunt down various outlaws around the map. The “Stranger Missions” are absolutely phenomenal\, each with their own self contained and captivating little narratives that span 3-5 missions for each\, there are a total of 16 stranger missions in the game that have been found and the amount of detail and work put into them is surprising and really sets the bar high for other titles. The Bounty Hunting is surprisingly varied as you go from just simply finding a bounty\, killing all of his friends and taking him back to the Sheriff on the back of your stallion to finding an outlaw who’s supposedly “changed his ways” with a struggling family who begs you to let him say his goodbyes before he comes peacefully\, you let him\, you hear him tell his son to “do what I told you to you” and think nothing of it. During the trip your bounty slips out of his bonds and tries to escape\, you quickly hogtie him and chuck him back up on your horse\, all seems okay from there until four of his former gang members ambush you and reveal that your bounty’s son was told to go warn them\, you kill them and finally get him back to the sheriff as he begs for release. That is how varied these missions are.Finally\, I’ll touch on the gameplay:While admittedly slow and semi-clunky\, the gameplay really hits its mark when trying to be weighty and brutal\, once the (again\, admittedly) confusing controls have been gotten used to and you’ve had some time to work out what works and what doesn’t\, the gameplay can be very smooth and enjoyable\,  gameplay ranges from sitting down at a campfire with a few gang members as you drink your morning coffee and sing a sing under the rising sun to dual wielding sawed off shotguns\, completely decapitating people and having massive bar fights that show off the much Improved and visceral melee system.Overall I’d have to say that this is one of the best single player experiences I have ever had and also one of the best plots (in my opinion) presented in any form of entertainment in the last 50 or so years. A phenomenal game and definitely worth a buy\, if not the more expensive editions. Absolutely wonderful.… Expand",True,0.11367676,0.0066375732,0.025605056,0.03158728,0.08290444,0.020609349

I'm not even sure it's an 8\, even though that's where I'm going to round my score to; I'd give it a 7.5 if I could do half scores.Pros:+ Beautiful open world+ Engaging story\, though the protagonist is extremely dense+ Open world elements present to the player organically rather than as a checklist of things to collect/do.Cons:- Minutia bogs down every aspect of the game.- Gunplay is horrid\, significantly worse than the first.- Wildly inconsistent crime system.The pros speak for themselves\, but I must elaborate on the cons. From the very onset of the game\, it's made clear that you will be spending a large amount of your playtime managing the minutia of gameplay systems. Wear the appropriate clothing so you're not too hot or cold\, or you'll lose stamina. Brush your horse or your horse loses stamina. Eat regularly or you'll lose health and stamina\, but don't eat too much or you'll become overweight and have less stamina. Hunt for the camp\, pay money for the camp\, upgrade the camp (no one else does). Shave and bathe or the townsfolk won't interact with you positively. Clean your guns or they'll lose stats and eventually jam. Make sure you hunt silently and stay downwind so your scent doesn't startle your prey (or use scent masker).These systems start out enjoyable but devolve into complete tedium within a few hours -- and they NEVER let up. The quality of the story telling is bogged down entirely by the constant need to play Camping and Outlaw Simulator 1899.Also one of the most frustrating elements of the game is the crime system and how inconsistent it is. A couple examples: At one point I forgot to stow my Lancaster Repeater on my saddlebags and accidentially walked into the town of Strawberry holding it. A townsfolk decided I was disturbing the peace by doing so and ran to tell the Sheriff. I thought nothing of it\, concluded my business\, and left town. Moments later\, I had a $10 bounty on my head and lawmen closing in on every side\, shooting at me indiscriminantly\, all for a disturbing the peace charge. Riding down the road in the second chapter\, an O'Driscall man opened fire on me as I passed by and knocked my horse out from under me. I killed him in self defense and hid the body in the woods. A few moments later\, after I'm LONG gone from the area\, I get a notification that a crime has been reported and I'm wanted for murder with a $40 bounty. Despite no one having seen me there beyond the guy I shot dead.These incidents happen frequently. Defending yourself in fist fights or gun fights often ends up with YOU being the target of law. Even if you have high honor and no other bounties on your head. Then sometimes you can get into a fistfight in the middle of town\, beat a guy to death\, and get no repurcussions at all.Rockstar has always been hit-or-miss with their gunplay mechanics and when they initially released the first RDR in 2010 I was scared it would be a miss. Pleasantly the gun play in that game was top notch\, better than most other Rockstar games. The same cannot be said for RDR2. The gun mechanics are back to the same old GTA5\, sluggish\, awful\, design that leans heavily on aim assist to be useful. Even Dead Eye is a shell of its former self. I find myself avoiding gunfights entirely because the gunplay is so underwhelming and unrewarding.Unlike the first game\, I'm not finding myself wanting to complete every challenge\, or find every herb\, or upgrade every item. The minutia has had an opposite effect on my play. I have one maxed horse and I couldn't give a damn about any others. I'm not busting my ass to buy item upgrades and I'm no longer bothering with camp chores because I'm only going back to camp when I have to launch story missions. It's easier to stay in a hotel or camp out anyway. The first RDR is a game I happily platinumed; RDR2 is a game I'll probably play once and never play again.… Expand",True,0.054037213,0.0042533875,0.016460562,0.019999169,0.062454045,0.012854968

Difficulty is laughable\, even playing in first person with all aim assist turned on. Enemies take multiple hits\, and you are a tank. There's lots of standing in the open and shooting at each other from 10 feet away\, out of cover\, shaving off health with multiple shots. Basically gives everything a very low energy\, low pressure feeling even with all assists turned off\, so that you feel no excitement. The whole experience just feels like a chore. Free aim is terribly clunky\, and hit detection is something they still haven't got the hang of without lock on turned on. I'm a very mediocre gamer\, and this was one of the easiest game I've played\, and not in a good way. Enemies are identical in behavior and armament\, and don't behave organically enough to justify the sameness on the grounds of \""realism\"". Last but not least\, a lot of boring riding through the same forested landscape. Its wants to be the Witcher but lacks the beauty\, variety\, and depth of the countryside. It also can't get off its own shaft\, and constantly make you ride the same area and pause so the developers can jerk themselves and make you look at their masterpiece. Never though\, did I have organic moment like in other games where I stopped to admire.Story:Bad. But I have a much higher bar for stories than most people\, while my gameplay bar is about average. Still if you like HBO stuff more than say FOX or NBC\, the story will disappoint. It's the same tragic tale as last time\, with very inconsistently written characters. The dialogue is great in some cases\, but the overall story is very lacking. The biggest issue is the attempt to paint Arthur as the good guy\, vs just a likeable bad guy.When you murder 700 law abiding government officials\, its hard to portray the guy as a classic hero\, but try they do. To make it doable\, the employ the laziest method ever\, which is to make everyone else racist\, and Arthur and his gang of barely literate horse thieves and prostitute feminists and equality centric. Why is it okay that Arthur is killing trains full of 18 year US Army personal just doing a job? Oh\, because they are\, every one of them racists\, so now Arthur the murdering thieve is a nice guy do-gooder. Dumb + lazy writing. Makes me wish for Niko again. Didn't pretend to be a good guy any more than Scarface\, so when he thinned out the ranks of the NYPD\, it still made sense.Value for money:Low. They claim like 200 hours in bonus activity\, but this isn't the case. You end the game with tons of money\, with nothing in the game world to spend it on. Even if you did have something worth buying\, you wouldn't be able to make it. All side activities pay very poorly. Robbing a store (banks are not robbable???) pays 30$\, meanwhile the bounty you'll rack up escaping will be a minimum of 400$ bounty if you want to have any fun\, and you can lose thousands if you die. Bounties pay nothing\, like 80$ on average\, and hunting fishing is boring (somehow the only viable option is with a bow\, and you there are so many animals you can just ride up to them and dead eye\, making it pointless to go looking) and pays very little. Stick ups pay 50 cents\, and always go the same way. Poker games are limited to 5$\, also making them pointless.  I think the reason the post game feels so dead is to force people into online.Overall 3/10The dialogue and some of the mini quests gets it to 3\, but the awful gameplay\, lacking 2d story and the total pointlessness of doing money making mission post game keep me from going any higher.… Expand",True,0.30136615,0.01683561,0.06749674,0.14331897,0.19278693,0.108496375

79046,RDR2,2018-11-20,4.0,"People who are rating this 9-10 are out of their damn minds.Controls are janky and awkward with cover fire functions being clunky during intense firefights that require you to move from cover to cover seamlessly.  The AI is quite stupid.  And the rules of the world are heavily skewed  against you in an infuriating way.  A man shoots you?  You knock him out\, cool you're wanted for murder.  The AI is clumsy  and tend to blame you for crimes including crimes other AI commit right in front of the supposed witness.   On top of all that\, they are all knowing when it comes to actual crime and unless you wear a mask\, somehow complete strangers will identify your exact name.That's not even the worst part.  The worst part is the story.Lazy\, repetitive story.  Nobody in their right mind would follow Dutch throughout the entire campaign.  It literally makes no sense and all loyalty the characters supposedly have are never established so the player doesn't understand or feel what they feel.  Nothing goes right since day 1\, why would anyone believe Arthur's gang holds Dutch in such high esteem?  Dutch keeps saying the same lines over and over for 5 chapters \""this is the last score\""\, \""this is the last time\""\, Jesus I wish Rockstar had a shoot yourself button in this game.  I can't even count how many times I heard that line. The effect\, is that you aren't following the mentality of the protagonist Arthur's disillusionment of Dutch because it's been painful clear he's a moron since chapter 1.  It's like watching your stupid friend take 5 days to realize 1+1=2.  Maybe somebody out they considers that riveting storytelling\, but what makes good stories memorable are the ones where you are mentally in the character's mind.  And Rockstar made that damn near impossible.  The writing is so spectacularly bad\, it's almost impressive.  The fact that they have the audacity to make the player sit through endless chapters of the same moronic characters doing the same moronic things\, saying the same moronic lines over and over again only in different locations is crazy.  And the fact nobody seemed to notice or mind is pretty amazing.The game itself is beautiful\, and the small bits in the actual open world are great.  In fact\, do yourself a favor and don't play the story.  just roam the world\, explore and stay in chapter 1 because it's just irritating disappointment from then on if you follow the story.If you do follow the story\, just play until chapter 4 and watch the rest on youtube.  I'm not sure what happened around chapter  5\,  did Rockstar just throw in the towel and give the game to another studio?  Whoever worked on the last 2 chapters\, deserves to be fired it was so bad.  Felt like a dumber version of Far Cry for a good 2 hours.Don't let the good work of the artists trick you into thinking the core content of the game is actually any good.  The story should have been shorter and tighter instead of the meandering and meaningless journey it actually is.  A polished turd is still a turd.… Expand",True,0.6544696,0.27908814,0.2783691,0.5739874,0.541926,0.2836219

At first I didn't really care for Arthur as the main character because I wanted more of John but he really grows on you and I have really enjoyed his story.  All the side content to keep you busy while progressing the story is amazing.  I love hunting\, fishing\, playing poker and other games.  The chance encounters really keep the experience refreshing because you never know what's going to happen as your out riding around on your horse.

In your first few moments in the game\, footprints in the snow\, to the lighting from your torches reflecting as you explore your surroundings on the mountain\, this game is an immersive treat right from the opening scene.After some character introductions on the mountain\, both new and returning characters\, which is such a huge fan service to anyone who loved the first RDR and want to know some of the returning characters back stories\, the visuals become even more stunning as you and your gang make your way onto greener pastures.  Every blade of grass\, every sunset\, every thunder storm\, every animal and every npc feel like they are a part of another world with their own purpose.Without spoiling too much\, I cannot believe how many random interactions I've come across that are completely unexpected.  How I've went completing main story mission\, to finding a cult long expired\,  reading their mass suicide note and then seeing a UFO above you. Or helping a random person who is clearly in rough shape\, unable to stay on their own horse\, then taking them to a doctor\, only to watch an amputation of a guys arm with a saw and then see the doctor throw it in a garbage can afterwards.  There are so many moments that in RDR2 that make several other decent open world games from this gen seem like they're recycling random npc actions.I've found that it is so easy to sit down and intend to play for just an hour and lose 4 real world hours. Its very clear that Rockstar has redefined the open world genre once again with RDR2 this gen.The writing of the main story missions is on point\, if the scenes were being presented on Netflix\, its likely you'd be watching it right now.

In your first few moments in the game\, footprints in the snow\, to the lighting from your torches reflecting as you explore your surroundings on the mountain\, this game is an immersive treat right from the opening scene.After some character introductions on the mountain\, both new and returning characters\, which is such a huge fan service to anyone who loved the first RDR and want to know some of the returning characters back stories\, the visuals become even more stunning as you and your gang make your way onto greener pastures.  Every blade of grass\, every sunset\, every thunder storm\, every animal and every npc feel like they are a part of another world with their own purpose.Without spoiling too much\, I cannot believe how many random interactions I've come across that are completely unexpected.  How I've went completing main story mission\, to finding a cult long expired\,  reading their mass suicide note and then seeing a UFO above you. Or helping a random person who is clearly in rough shape\, unable to stay on their own horse\, then taking them to a doctor\, only to watch an amputation of a guys arm with a saw and then see the doctor throw it in a garbage can afterwards.  There are so many moments that in RDR2 that make several other decent open world games from this gen seem like they're recycling random npc actions.I've found that it is so easy to sit down and intend to play for just an hour and lose 4 real world hours. Its very clear that Rockstar has redefined the open world genre once again with RDR2 this gen.The writing of the main story missions is on point\, if the scenes were being presented on Netflix\, its likely you'd be watching it right now.

79130,RDR2,2019-09-17,8.0,"My review is only for the single player as I have not played the online (as I have no interest in Red Dead Online). Also\, I never played the first gameAfter spending well over 120+ hours on this game's single player over the last 2 and a half months\, I can say that RDR2 is a good game\, but definitively not a 10/10 perfect game. I hardly take mainstream reviews seriously these days. I still watch them from time to time\, but I take what they say with a grain of salt.The Pros:•	Great single player campaign.•	Great characters with incredible voice acting and all 15+ members of the Van der Linde gang have missions that you get to do with them to get to know them better.•	Interactions between NCPs outside of missions. This is one of the first open world games that I've seen where NPCs will interact with each other outside of missions in unique ways every time when compared to other open world games where NPCs will remain static doing the same thing repeatedly outside of mission. The random interactions between gang members combined with the missions makes none of the members of the gang feel like throwaway characters.•	Incredible graphics with amazing attention to detail. This by far the most detailed AAA game I have ever played. From the detail in combat (i.e. bullet holes in humans and animals\, bleed out kills\, gore\, carcasses & corpses decaying over time\, etc.) to the other details in free roam gameplay are all incredible.•	Great variety of weapons\, horses\, clothes\, and other miscellaneous items & features to customize your character.•	Consumable items in your inventory to restore your health and special ability\, which is the deadeye mechanic.The Cons:•	Bad control scheme and bad button mapping. I seriously don’t understand why RDR2 STILL uses Rockstar’s outdated control scheme. The standard fps control scheme did improve my experience and make the controls more tolerable. The controls are tolerable at best\, and frustrating at their worst.•	Bad input lag which severely affects the game’s movement and aiming. The movement and aiming in this game are slow\, clunky\, and stiff.•	The free aim is a joke\, and the snap in and out of cover auto-aim takes all the skill out of shooting. Yes\, you can change some setting to make free aim more tolerable\, but even after playing around with the setting it still didn’t feel as good as the aiming in other games.•	Flawed wanted system.•	Flawed honor system.I would have given the game a 9/10 if it wasn’t for several little things. Little things matter and they add up.This list is a list of little things that I had complaints about\, and it is not a full list\, I’ve written down all the things that I could think of now writing this review:•	No horse insurance. You can spend hundreds of dollars buying a horse\, customizing it\, and spend time bonding with it to improve its stats\, and all it takes to lose it permanently is death. I heard that Red Dead online has horse insurance\, so I don’t understand why the single player can’t have it.•	Weapons being locked until you reach a certain point in the story.•	Your character always holstering your two equipped long arms in your main horse every time you mount it and having to re-equip them every time you dismount.•	The non-existent stealth mechanics outside of missions.•	Having to get out of cover and/or having to tap R2 again after firing to rechamber a round into the barrel chamber of your weapon.•	Missions being very linear and restrictive in the way that you can approach them and handle the combat scenarios.•	Flawed inventory system that could be improved.•	Animals not always appearing in the area that they are marked on the open-world map.•	Some animals being so rare to the point that the standard version is more legendary that the legendary version (i.e. grizzly bear\, moose\, panther\, armadillo\, etc).•	QTEs to free yourself from a predator’s grasp instead of a button mashing sequence.•	Restrictive slow movement in camps/safe zones which does nothing but slow the pacing of the game for no reason.•	Camp chores being useless filler content. You can get honor a lot faster by going into town and greeting every NPC you see.•	Slow start to the game.•	Slow looting and interaction with items. This one is more subjective\, but I have to say that the detailed looting animations look cool the first couple of hours\, but after 40 hours\, they get tedious and annoying.•	The number of things that need maintenance in this game. The sheer number of things to maintain in this game start to get in the way of having fun.You would think that I hate the game for the sheer number thing that I complained about\, but the thing is that underneath all the flaws\, there is the potential of an incredible game.

The story has tons of humor and crudeness which is expected in a Rockstar game\, but the time period creates so much charm in the debauchery that you can't help but giggle as you lasso someone on their wagon and drag them behind your horse to death. RDR2 generates so much excitement around what was a pivotal period in American history. Most people who bash the game couldn't handle the complicated controls. Yes the controls are pretty bad\, but not in an unresponsive way like input lag. The control issues stem from the obsession for \""ultra realistic\"" graphics to the point of madness. The fact that every action has a button means that some commands wind up overlapping. R2 might initiate an item pickup when close to it\, but the default action for the button is quick draw your weapon and fire. You can see how this goes from trying to take a shot at Valentine saloon to torches and pitchforks because you accidentally Drew and shot someone in the corner.This is still a must play game.

The characters are all well-developed and you feel drawn in to a realistic\, but exciting wild west.\n\nRD2 also benefits from the way its story isThis game deserves a 7 based on the following characteristics: 1. Excellent story 2. Immersive world 3. Frustrating mechanics 4. Unoriginal and generic gameplay.1. Excellent StoryThere has never been a game with such a compelling story. The characters are all well-developed and you feel drawn in to a realistic\, but exciting wild west.RD2 also benefits from the way its story is told. The story is interwoven into every quest and surprises you at almost every turn. This is still a standard western with all the typical plot points: outlaw on the run\, unrequited love\, etc. But the game delivers these points in a continually fresh way. For example\, sometimes a main quest is labeled with one character's name when it actually revolves around another.2. Immersive WorldEvery new location you visit in the game is distinct and interesting in its own way.When you enter a town\, the people that live there have their own personalities and occupations. And there is always some driving force to the town - it might be the clash of two wealthy families\, or the mischief carried out by the city king pin.The outdoors is a mix of wild life\, adventurers\, and bandits. You can set out in any direction and find entertaining things to do when you get there. Whether hunting a deer or taking out an enemy camp\, there are plenty of distractions to take you off the main course.3. Frustrating (but learnable) mechanicsThe main character\, Arthur Morgan\, moves really slowly. I've read multiple reviews that make this sound like a perk\, but be assured that it is not. He barely moves and the only way to move even a little faster is to constantly press the \""x\"" button. My hand was killing me. (It's even worse when riding your horse).Shooting is ok. However\, the dead eye feature (freezing time to shoot) is not as cool or useful as advertised. I'll admit I couldn't get it to work at first\, but this actually didn't give me a problem. It's easy enough to focus your gun on enemies and just shoot them. However\, it's not that fun. Also\, I would sometimes die on the first time through a mission because I entered the fight from the wrong angle. Once I died and came back to life\, the game automatically adjusted me to the correct position. I'm glad I could continue on with the game\, but this obviously took me out of the moment and gave the fight an artificial quality. This game is really stiff.4. Unoriginal and Generic GameplayThere is nothing original about RD2's gameplay. In fact\, despite some denying that it is anything like Grand Theft Auto\, it IS exactly like that!The main quests are tied into the story which keeps them interesting. But when you're not doing that what can you find? A fetch quest\, and another fetch quest: bring the horse to the seller\, deliver the letter\, bring the lost person into town. And you know what? There's nothing wrong with that! Until game developers find a way to fill these massive worlds with original content we're going to have a lot of fetch quests. But this is not original content and that's why inflated reviews from the major gaming sites trouble me.One review site in particular (the biggest one) has a regular love fest about this game\, where the critic turns all the game's flaws into perks and ignores any of the obvious problems. (Having to click the same button twice to reload your gun is not a plus...it's not necessarily a negative either but it's ridiculous to paint these aspects of the game as somehow beneficial). I've come to the conclusion that such reviews are for entertainment and not for information.I have nothing against users who rated this game as a 9 or 10. However\, I must note that the mediocre and low user reviews on Metacritic are much more detailed than the high score reviews. In other words\, it's easy to come on here and say \""this game is great!\"" without justifying your opinion\, but much harder to defend it.RD2 is a great game and most people will have a fun time playing it. It's the next step in action and role-playing video games. However\, don't come into this expecting something revolutionary. You're sure to be disappointed.… Expand",True,,,,,,

Not in the sense that it has a rich lore and limitless replayability\, but in the sense that it feels like it was made in 2002. The movement is clunky and cumbersome. The interaction controls are painstakingly terrible. The loading screens are long and the framerate choppy. The crime and bounty system makes North Korea look like a benevolent\, forgiving regime. And the honor system completely kneecaps the best (and sometimes only good) part of Rockstar games; Going on a rampage.I should start by saying that I haven't finished the game (and probably won't). I got to chapter 4 (compendium says I'm 45% done with the story) in the story before completely losing interest. The story so far has been uninspiring and bland\, with every 'twist' being cliche and stale. The story missions feel like extended quick time events\, where you fail instantly for trying to do anything but strictly follow the script. Arthur Morgan\, the player character\, is an absolute moron that acts like a bipolar maniac in cutscenes\, with little to no consistent characterization. Dutch\, the gang leader\, is a complete idiot\, but keeps dragging Arthur and everyone else into his hairbained schemes and messing everything up. There are multiple points in the story so far where there is no choice but to get a bounty that you have to pay yourself\, which feels needlessly restrictive and kills the RPG aspect of the game.Crime and punishment is another glaring problem. If an NPC so much as bumps into your horse in Saint Denis\, you'll instantly get charged with unarmed assault and dozens of policemen will charge\, guns blazing\, to their deaths over your $5 bounty. Meanwhile\, you can be shot at and run over by a carriage while the police sit there twiddling there thumbs. On top of that\, bounties don't go away unless you pay them. This wouldn't be a problem\, if having a bounty didn't open you up to constant attacks by magical teleporting bounty hunters and effectively prohibit you from doing any sort of missions in town. On top of the bounty system\, there is also the honor system. The honor system disproportionately rewards you for acting as a good Samaritan\, and punishes you for acting like an outlaw. It also penalizes you for shooting back when under fire\, and then again for looting the corpse of your former assailant. The biggest problem with the honor system\, however\, is that it gives you a long term punishment for going on a crime spree\, which has historically been the best part of Rockstar games.The biggest problem by far\, however\, is the utter lack of quality of life features present in RDR2. Apparently\, at some point\, somebody at Rockstar decided that immersion meant utter lack of QOL features. Movement is slow\, and requires stamina that must be refilled manually through eating and sleeping (there are also long term debuffs for not regularly eating). The same applies to your horse\, with the added annoyance that galloping requires you to tap X\, thus seriously hampering the players ability to control the camera. When in buildings or your camp\, you cannot run\, and are instead required to walk at a geriatric pace until you cross the area threshold and can return to your still slow but not as slow running speed. There is no map-accessed fast travel\, with the only ways to fast travel being from town to town with trains and coaches\, or via your a map in your camp. Getting back to the camp is often a chore\, in which you are in a constant battle with your horse to not plow head long into a nearby tree. The slow movement is made worse by the sheer amount of open space to cover in the world. Further QOL issues include only being able to hunt one large animal at a time\, your weapons automatically unequipping when you get on your horse\, and your ammo automatically reverting to standard.Now for the positives. Although the world has a lot of empty space\, it is very expansive\, with a wide variety of environments and a lot of NPCs\, flavorless as the may be. The level of detail is incredible\, with your clothes carrying over dirt and blood until you bathe or rest at camp. If you interact with NPCs at a homestead\, you can return later and see actual impacts of what you did to them (if you shoot someone in the leg and come back\, they may have a crutch).Overall\, there's some really great potential in this game that is handicapped by some terrible gameplay design decisions\, a poor story with bad characters\,  and technical limitations of the Playstation… Expand",True,0.23523538,0.013414118,0.07508347,0.07428485,0.13608865,0.026997874

Again\, rinse and repeat everything to the point of nausea.Side \""incidents\"" started to repeat themselves by the end.You'd go into missions with your preferred guns\, and the game would swap them out and force you to use what it wanted you to.Guns would disappear out of your inventory\, and you'd have to buy them again.I could go on and on\, but there's just too many issues to put down.The only mission I cared about was in Chapter 6 concerning the Native Americans\, and they even managed to **** that up to with some really stupid story and gameplay-mechanic decisions.How this has been getting 10/10's from critics is totally beyond comprehension - unless Rockstar paid for them. Same with users\, but some people can't see beyond their adoration for all things Rockstar.I expected so much more after GTA5 and RDR (1)\, so to say this was a disappointment would be a (sad) understatement.… Expand",True,0.1587729,0.008735657,0.026207991,0.037980765,0.12903778,0.04201601

79214,RDR2,2018-11-23,7.0,"I don't think I've ever looked forward to a game as much as this one\, but ultimately I feel a little let down. Sure\, the game looks amazing the level of detail is really great. The design is all over the place\, however. The game wants to be a survival simulator\, making you watch your weight\, temperature\, etc. This even extends to your horse; if it's dirty it will take more damage. Your horse will be dirty all the time. This means as the gang rides off to a heist\, you'll be stuck behind\, brushing your horse yet again. I feel like micro details like this should have been flagged during play testing\, because no one likes it. No one likes having to scrub each body part in the tub. It's ridiculous. Just give us a bathing animation and be done with it. This sort of busy work is pervasive throughout the game\, including the stingy fast travel\, which lets you travel one-way (after unlocking it) but still makes you ride long distances\, constantly. The beautiful scenery begins to feel stale after the 40th gallop through it. For a long time I dreaded the cheap ambushes by rival gangs\, but then I craved them\, just to break up the boredom.The controls are also awful\, even after tinkering with them. 99% of my crimes in town were a result of the controls\, either I would shoot someone on accident\, or while running and trying to mount my horse I would instead begin strangling an innocent bystander. This made the busy work they give you even more tedious\, as I would have to flee town after just trying to come in and take a bath.My biggest gripe\, however\, is with the story\, or lack thereof. It's sad that the bar for a 'good' story in video games is so low. This story has no narrative hook\, it's a lot of 'day in the life of an outlaw' which again grows stale as you continue missions with your bungling gang. Arthur's story of redemption in cut scenes is marred by your actions in the game. You talk about being a good man and then five minutes later you're back to murdering people for their belt buckles. The game coyly avoids any satisfaction in Arthur's overall story\, climaxing with Arthur and Micah exchanging blows through the game's horribly stiff melee combat system without resolution. Then\, in a supreme middle finger to the player\, the game acts like you are starting a new game and makes you do mundane ranch tasks as John Marston. You'll play this 'new' game for hours and hours before finally getting some resolution in the final chapter (which was great and only about 60 hours overdue). I will say I enjoyed the epilogues much more than the main game\, it was the old west world I wanted to play through in the first place.The legendary hunts are also a huge disappointment. Hunting is really fun in the game\, however\, these hunts were the easiest kills! Simply find the clues\, run between them\, then when the legendary animal spawns\, simply plug it with a few explosive rifle rounds and collect the pelt. I wish they had the same stringent rules as regular pelts to add a challenge. To me the best hunt was the rare cougar in the dark cave. That was a legendary hunt.Also\, while I liked Arthur and found him to be a great character\, I think it was a huge missed opportunity not to make Sadie Adler the protagonist of the game. You find her at this disastrous moment in her life\, then you could have learned to be an outlaw over the course of the game under Arthur's tutelage.Overall there is a lot of great game here (especially the little side stories out in the world\, like the widow and Hamish) but I think the game is not a perfect 10 by any means.… Expand",True,0.15987846,0.009841919,0.02721288,0.046178754,0.15459715,0.030278467

As high as they possibly could have.With that said\, you can really taste the blood and sweat of the people who made this game. It is the most vivid and beautiful world ever created. Hat's off. But when you look at the rest of the game\, it has problems.First of all\, I really feel like they should've gone with a brand new story with brand new characters. It felt kind of lazy with this prequel format. I felt done with these characters already. Dutch\, especially\, is a pretty dumb character to begin with and isn't half as charming and charismatic as they want you to believe he is. And the rest are just kind of there.And I didn't really feel that the way the story developed was very believable either. It lost it's momentum halfway through and became a bit repetitive and predictable and the actions of the characters (also of the protagonist) didn't make any sense. It became more and more painful to witness and just go along with all these stupid decisions. The protagonist (Arthur Morgan) is as passive as he could possibly be. Rockstar did promise ahead of release that you would get to affect the outcome of the story. Something I value above all in gaming. That's not the case at all.Then we have the very clumsy mechanics and physics of the game. VERY frustrating at times and it could really screw you and take you out of the experience. Like riding your horse into a tree or off a cliff. Or maybe you accidentally shoot or ride into a NPC. I spent A LOT of bounty money on accidents.Then we have Arthur himself. Very slow and clumsy to handle. Especially when you want to walk through your gigantic **** camp in order to quickly save the game or to change your outfit.And what about the whole weight system? I ate and ate and f*cking ate\, but was underweight throughout the entire game. I tried EVERYTHING. Am I supposed to spent half of my friggin gametime eating? That's insane.And there isn't nearly enough cool or diverse clothing to boast the experience and make Arthur your own.. Most of it doesn't suit even Arthur at all\, and most of it is really difficult (as in prolixly) to get your hands on. (IE: hunting) Do you really want to spend 6 hours to get a damn rathat?Then we have RDR Online beta. Absolute travesty. I did not enjoy GTA V Online at all. It was a pointless and juvenile way of spending your time. I was hoping RDR would make the most of it's rather vast online potential. But it did not deliver in any way. There is no point to it except to make your very own character. Something I wanted to do in the story mode.There's probably other things that has temporary slipped my mind. But ultimately this was a very good game. It was the best gaming experience I've had for quite some years now. It is really a beautiful game and it has A LOT going for it. Don't get me wrong.

Is there anything more frustrating than being completely excited for a game you just spent 60 bucks on only to get home and realize an hour in that you have been had? The latest con job I fell victim to was Red Dead 2. Even after reading the amazing positive reviews for this dud\, I still wasn't convinced.

My thinking was that the writers of SP must have loved the game themselves to plug it on the show. Wrong!Let's start with the few positives I can give you about this yawn factory. It's a beautiful world full of realistic  and detailed scenery. It has good voice acting\, for the most part and the game mechanics are not terrible but also nothing new. There\, that's the positives\, and that's it. Anyone who tells you anything different is either a paid reviewer\, a complete liar or someone with very\, very\, very low expectations when it pertains to gaming.There are only a few things I need to know before a game purchase.  Is it something new? What is the level of difficulty and most importantly\, is it fun? Lets take them in order. Is it something new?  Emphatically the answer is a resounding no. It is more of the same quests you find in just about every game you play these days. What is the level of difficulty? This is hard to answer because most quests seemed like more of a chore than an exciting activity\, but as a Dark Souls loving\, repeatedly dying\, rise to a challenge gamer\, I found it incredibly easy. At this point you might be saying to yourself\, \""this doesn't sound too terrible\""\, and you would be right in that assumption if it weren't for one more thing. It is not fun. It is un-fun. It is boring. It is a pointless endeavor of lack luster travel time. You spend the majority of your time on your horse\, galloping for what seems like endless hours only to finally reach a destination that requires you to do some simple task as part of a quest\, that takes 3 seconds to complete. Then its back in the saddle again\, to return to where you started\, for another boring quest preceded bu the worlds longest horsey ride. This flaw supersedes all another details of this game. I hesitate to even call it a game. Games are fun or exciting or at least make you curious as to an outcome. Not this piece of garbage. It is absolutely one of the most boring 25 hours I have ever spent on a game. What added insult to injury is the lure of activating the fast travel option\, which essentially only leads to more horse play.

Mountains\, lakes\, pastures\, towns\, animals\, people\, the sky\, everything you see is beautiful. There is a little pop-in here and there\, a little frame rate drops here and there\, but technically the game is among the best of the generation. Such a high graphical quality I'd expect only from Sony's 1st party games like God of War and Horizon: Zero Dawn.Gameplay-wise RDR2 is at its best when just roaming the map outside of missions and bumping into strangers\, where anything can happen. From a brawl fist\, to a robbery\, to a nice chat\, to a side quest\, or even become wanted and have Bounty Hunters chasing you. You can also do some random stuff like playing poker or go fishing.RDR2 is a game about cowboys and outlaws in the Wild West\, but the whole shooting system is just laughable. Rockstar has aim assist turned on by default because manual aiming is bad and they can't bother to fix it. Aim assist coupled with the Dead Eye mechanic (slow motion and lock on target) and brain-dead NPCs means you rarely need to aim your gun before shooting. Controls are needlessly complex even for the simplest actions. You almost think you must be playing an MMO on console. Missions are almost on-rails despite the wide open field of the map\, with little room for improvisation. The constant need to ride a horse for several minutes when getting from point A to point B during missions doesn't help the game's pace. The same problem existed on the 1st game\, but here it's worse.The story is meh. Arthur doesn't compare well with RDR's protagonist John Marston\, and he is little more than a typical nameless avatar. The gang features several members\, but none of these characters stands out.RDR2 Online is currently in Open Beta\, but it's sadly Pay To Win. You buy guns and upgrades with gold\, which can either be earned freely or bought with real-world money. You actually have to grind for 100s of hours in order to earn enough free gold to buy anything\, so paying for gold with real money is strongly encouraged by Rockstar. Rockstar may improve RDR2's economy\, lower weapons' gold prices\, or increase the rate gold is awarded for free\, but when you sell guns and upgrades in your game for real money\, it's still Pay To Win no matter how you call it. For an online game\, Pay To Win is the ultimate sin. I suggest players not taking RDR2 Online seriously and competitively\, just play a little and enjoy it as much as you can without buying gold with your money. There are other online games that respect players instead of ripping them off.I have been disappointed by RDR2. Other than its graphics\, nothing in this game can justify the hype.

I did not enjoy GTA V\, but was mind blown by RDR 2 (I never played RDR 1)\, so much so I bought GTA V again to give it a second chance now that I'm seeing Rockstar in a new light.Gameplay is revolutionary\, with so many moments where I was dropping my jaw in awe of something that's never been done before in any game. This is how you make a game. No bugs and crashes during my 100+ hr playthrough (been playing everyday since release on Oct 26 for 2-3 hrs average per session). Super smooth gameplay experience with no loading screens during my play sessions.I would highly recommend not to use any guides or walkthroughs as the game has tons of surprises for you when you explore at your own pace which makes the game full of unforgettable content\, not the kind of filler/grindy content in some other games. Also\, if you want to challenge yourself\, turn off auto aim and try not to use Dead Eye whenever possible cos the gun fights feel so visceral that way. The Dead Eye mechanic though\, is uber cool\, a la Max Payne.If you're into graphics like I am\, then RDR2 will floor you. The BEST graphics currently\, no question. I've been playing games on PS4 since 2015 and I've seen some truly outstanding looking games like The Witcher 3\, Uncharted 4\, Hellblade\, The Order 1886\, God of War\, but for me\, this takes the cake. Also\, one of the best things about RDR2 to me is that the UI/HUD is super clean\, zero clutter.

This game\, i really really want to like it. But it misses in so many places and just feels punishing and unrewarding. I'll start with the pace of the game. It. Is. Slow. Feels like you travel on a horse for about 10 minutes in real time\, for a ride that would probably only take under 5 if you were not restricted of movement. If your in camp\, you walk. Indoors? Your walking. Scouting a boat? Your gonna follow it on your horse.....in a slow trot for 10 minutes\, all because the game locks your speed in certain areas and locations for i don't know\, immersion? Dialogue? Cinematic Effect? I get it\, this games scope is to be an immersive western experience\, but it is not fun to move a character who feels like he has cinder blocks tied to his feet\, especially since there is NO FAST TRAVEL. Also in between locations you could technically \""hunt\"" or stop and help people\, hunting is basically lock on\, shoot the animal on your horse\, get off\, skin it (which is a good 10 second animation)\, put it on your horse\, and keep going. Congrats you just make 0.13 cents\, that's about a cent for each animation your gonna watch.Helping people however i will say feels pretty good\, and you do actually find that stopping to help these people really pays off by either getting items or some other payment. But i don't understand how i feel about spending 30 seconds to suck venom out of a guys leg and giving him some whiskey giving me more satisfaction than an hour in a main quest. I mean one guy gives you a free gun from the shop basically\, and you only spent 30 seconds to help him. However some main quests take 20 minutes of horse riding and 10 minutes of lock on head shot combat to give you 1600 bucks\, and 1000 of that is \""the gangs cut\"". And just a tip\, don't die\, cause chances are\, your gonna have to travel all the way back there\, or sit through another long dialogue scene\, and don't get me started with the panning sky shot of your character coming back every death. If you have ever saved and loaded the game\, you should know how long that shouldn't take. I don't know if there is a faster way to save\, but as far as i know all you can do is menu to it\, and save it. But thats not nearly as bad as the loads. Dear god the loads....My next point is the controls which could kinda be thrown in with pace of game. I remember when i first got to valentine\, i got wanted for running someone down on a horse in the first 5 minutes because i could not stop my horse. I just bought a gun from the store? Walk outside hit L2 to start dialogue\, accidentally aim at the sheriff now i'm in a gunfight with the whole town. You are either sprinting with 0 control pissing people off\, or you are basically crawling around begging for someone to put you out of your misery. If your riding your horse\, and you scratch a rock or tree\, or you fall about a foot\, your gonna go flying. Just super poor controls\, not a single positive comment i can make on them.The story gives no \""redemption\"" either. Missions are tedious tasks\, kill other gang members\, steal stuff\, or save fellow gang members. Combat is basically lock on shooting\, soooo i'm not even gonna waste a sentence to tell you why that's unacceptable. The inventory system is so lame\, so bad in fact that NPC's have to remind you not to forget your weapons on your horse. Let me put the weapon up if i don't want to hold it\, it shouldn't be a forced storage system. Its an open world RPG\, and ive never felt more limited in my choices. All of these things end up making your quests feel just exhaustive by the time it's over.I will take one moment to talk about some of the things i do enjoy about the game. The environment\, can be so good sometimes that it almost makes you forget that you are a slug. I also give some respect for the voice acting\, the actors add a western immersion more than just about anything.In conclusion\, this game has been mostly disappointing. I know I've just been ranting my frustration out on here\, but this is a $60 AAA title from one of the biggest game studios ever\, there is no excuse for some of this stuff. They've lost focus with their target audience\, if you're going to make an immersive western experience with lackluster controls\, at least make a story that won't let us set the controller down.

79331,RDR2,2019-08-21,6.0,"This game shows what happens if you take quality of your product seriously. In fact\, it might even show what happens if you take it TOO serious.Red Dead Redemption 2 looks beautiful\, has a great soundtrack\, impressive world design and shows detail in pretty much every department. The world is full with animals and people and doesn't feel like a big map with just some NPC's litteredThis game shows what happens if you take quality of your product seriously. In fact\, it might even show what happens if you take it TOO serious.Red Dead Redemption 2 looks beautiful\, has a great soundtrack\, impressive world design and shows detail in pretty much every department. The world is full with animals and people and doesn't feel like a big map with just some NPC's littered across it. With NPC's travelling in various ways\, doing things in towns and having random encounters with you the world feels alive. As many games have claimed this over the years\, this game actually accomplishes it.The story is well told and has a lot of characters that feel distinctive. The protagonist Arthur Morgan\, who is the center of moral in the game\, has an excellent story to tell which varies depending on your choices. You'll see the end of the Outlaw\, with the Van der Linde gang struggling to exist in the new world. The story deals with morality\, and how some members will develop due to the changes. It is  interesting to follow\, and you even get attached to some of the characters. Well done on that part.The gameplay itself is complex but entertaining. There is a clear push for realism within almost every aspect of the game\, but unfortunately the entertainment value suffers from trying to be realistic with all the animations\, inventory limitations and stiff aiming. It took me weeks before i fully adjusted\, which was probably longer than it should have. Horse riding becomes tedious very quickly\, as there is no fast travel until later in the story. On top of that\, every story mission (for which you had to travel to the mission trigger) will force you to ride even more while listening to endless conversations between Arthur and other NPC's. Sometimes too much realism is negative for your game\, and not having the option to fast travel has been a large source of frustration.I did notice quite a bit of bugs while playing\, and some mechanics like the bounty system seemed either broken or poorly designed. I had several instances where i would get a bounty for a crime i committed ten minutes before\, and while being miles away. The ability to hide your identity only works on civilians and not on lawmen\, which in itself is stupid\, and robbing trains is downright unnecessary when the bounty is higher than the loot. Is this a video game\, or an anti-outlaw simulator?Hunting can be fun and challenging\, but having to watch the skin animations over and over gets old after a while. Having a limit on the amount of big pelts you can store on your horse feels incredibly annoying when you have to walk across the map while carrying one yourself\, and having to whistle your horse to death to make sure he isn't dropping the second big pelt.A major problem with the game is its length and lack of proper fast travel. After completing Arthur's story\, the story is only 75% done. At this point a weaker story takes over\, and makes it a choir to force yourself to the end. My least enjoyable hours (and there's a lot of those) were pushing myself through boredom to finally end the story. This in combination with hours of boring horse riding really hurt my enjoyment of the game. And fast travel should never be something you unlock through gameplay\, what the hell Rockstar?Red Dead Online: Rockstar unfortunately decided to forget what they learned from GTA Online\, and turned Red Dead Online into one of the most unbalanced\, greedy and boring online modes that i've ever played. Prices of weapons\, clothing and even food are insanely high compared to the single player\, while valuables like rings\, necklaces and emblems have been reduced in worth. On top of that\, a new Premium Currency has been introduced called Gold Bars. You can earn these through grinding\, but getting a single one will take you around 8 hours. And considering gun customization of a single revolver can cost around 18 gold bars... It is conveniently throttling the economy of the game to make spending real money more enticing.In Summary\, this game impressed me with it's large amount of content\, detail and quality\, but also frustrated me by being way too long and tedious. The initial fun quickly descends into many hours of choirs and boredom as the game loses all its steam\, and crushed my interest of playing the game again after finishing the story. It also made me question the necessity of realism in games for the first time. When a game tries to be so realistic that it no longer feels as a game\, it becomes a simulator. I give this game a 6/10. A shorter and more linear game would have given me more satisfaction and less tedium.… Expand",True,0.15490346,0.0074386597,0.030691283,0.05144889,0.110447146,0.01508414

I'm not sure why\, but it felt a little like WestWorld (minus the crazy AI)Cons:- The map feels empty\, because of the points of interest are so distant from each other and there is nothing to do between them.- It's basically a horse riding simulator. Because of the empty spaces\, you have to ride... a lot! You ride 5 minutes\, do something\, and go back for another 5 minutes. Not to mention when they take your horse after some quests and you have to find a new one (since the fast travel system is awful).- Hunting is boring. It's so slow and you have to go back a lot to deliver the skins. First\, you need to find the animals. After that\, you need to locate a perfect skin animal (the others are bad)\, then you have to select the right weapon and ammo. If anyone passes near the place you are\, the animals run (a lot!). And you need to track them again.- The tracking system is horrible. You have to keep using it (and pressing the buttons) and it also slows down time\, which is annoying.- The shooting system is a mistake. It's so bad that I don't wanna play anymore.- Honor doesn't make sense. In the quests\, you can kill\, steal\, rob houses. And it does not affect your honor. They keep telling that's is ok to do it\, because you need and the world isn't a fair place. But when you search a corpse (that you didn't even kill)\, you lose honor. You have to keep saying hi to people to earn honor\, which is kinda ridiculous.- There are events to fix the slow pace of the gameplay. You need to ride a lot\, but sometimes you can get ambushed from other gangs or someone can try to steal your horse. It was supposed to be awesome. But you ride for so long\, that sometimes your mind isn't anymore in the game (plus the shooting system is terrible). And when that happens\, you probably going to die.- The details a boring and just a waste of time. Why do you need to brush your horse\, take a shower\, clean your weapon\, make coffee? I love managers and RPGs\, but those are just time consuming boring tasks.- The beginning is even slower. Why the snow? So much time needed to go from place to place. It was a terrible\, terrible way to start the game.- Fishing controls are bad. Why do you need to keep rotating the R button to bring the fish closer.- To play poker or any other game takes soooo long. Why? You keep seing many animations. Argh!Honestly\, what kills RDR2 for me are the controls\, the empty spaces and the boring/detailed tasks.

Had I known the game was going to look like this (not even close to GTA5) I would have never purchased it.  After spending hours trying to get HDR to work\, I finally went online and saw the issue isn't isolated to me.  So I followed others advice and disabled HDR in the game.This did help the game's graphics a little\, but it seems like it's blurry\, too dark at many times\, has a layer of graininess\, and the motion blur or whatever that's going on seems to make things worse.I can't believe the step down from GTA5 graphics.  This game was built for this gen platform yet it seems like many steps backwards.Are you guys trying to fix this\, or is this what I'm stuck with.  The game play seems to be fun\, but these graphics literally hinder me from seeing animals\, sometimes people\, etc. and truly make this a very unpleasant experience.There response and closed the ticket as resolved:Thank you for contacting Rockstar.We understand you are still experiencing graphical issues with Red Dead Redemption 2. I completely understand your frustration with this issue since the game is newer than GTA V and should have updated looked graphics with little to no issues.We are aware of players experiencing issues with HDR and graphics with the PS4 and are currently looking into it. We sincerely appreciate your patience while we look for a solution to this hindrance.If you have any other questions or concerns\, please do not hesitate to reach out to us again.Best regards\,Keelia K.Rockstar Support.This response was on 1/16/19Nearly 3 months from the release date.  Pretty much every review site says this is the greatest game for the ps4.  That's a big fat lie.  I have spent more time adjusting display settings than actually playing the game.It would be nice if game reviews were honest and quit misleading people.Yes\, the gameplay is fun\, when you can see what you're doing.

It was perfect and made sense-RNG random encounters\, we all know how these go\, they are fun the first time but when you see the same encounter with the same dialogue\, it gets stale\, fast. Luckily some encounters are scripted\, which is all this game seems to really do best at.-The UI is the worst I've ever seen in a while\, lots of flicking through and lots of needless work\, they could easily let the player assign items/weapons themselves\, we don't need everything jammed into one menu-The crafting is...ugh! Just try and sit to make split point bullets\, its like they didn't take into account this was a videogame-The amount of freedom you have during missions is very limited\, your just playing how they want you to\, now Rockstar have never been good at this\, but they at least tried with bank heist missions in GTA5-Animations for every little thing\, remember the worst aspect of RDR1 when you hunted something and had to wait 20 seconds for the animation to play\, its all over the place here\, there's animations for picking up individual items and its so slow!-Weapon variety is very stale\, most are the same weapons as in RDR1\, but at least the game has some unique weapons-The weapon upgrading isn't as good as it looks on the surface\, you have a lot of customization but very little tangible benefit\, I bet they will monetize this for online-The economy system is completely broken\, the game will throw money at you constantly\, taking out a large portion of the motivation to keep playing-Hunting is tedious and imo broken\, animals don't always spawn and you better hope to god its a 3 star. Another thing that bugs me is the fact you now have to use specfic weapons on specific animals\, but it makes no sense\, if I shoot any animal IN THE HEAD with an arrow\, how does it damage the pelt? It makes no sense to me.-The crime system is completely sensitive and punishing\, you bump into somebody and the law will murder you\, the game doesn't take things like self defence into account so if you kill somebody in self defence\, you will be killed. Not to mention there is no way to get rid of bounties than paying. Also\, is nobody is gonna mention how the bandana does ****In a game about being an outlaw its the most unfun outlaw game I've ever played.-Too many busy work elements that aren't shown to the player properly other than vague tutorials\, I can't for the life of me keep my weight consistent\, it would help if there was a bar or something\, c'mon! SanAndreas already nailed this aspect years ago.-The game world is actually devoid of content\, outside stranger missions and maybe 3 encounters like the incest couple\, there is nothing to really do in this game other than the stuff R* laid out for you\, they even made bounties entirely scripted for some reason\, this game might as well not even be open world\, I think it would work better for how much walking and talking there is.-The horse not being able to be called at a distance is such a stupid thing\, nobody cares about realism\, we play videogames to escape it and it actually gets in the way of enjoying your gamesI had to actively stop playing after the second chapter\, the game was bogging me down and the plot honestly felt like it was going nowhere but me doing tedious busywork like tailing missions\, I WANT to finish this game but its such a chore to play.

-the feel when you fire a weapon is so awesome especially from first person wow you can actually see and hear the weapon hitting and firing,,,,,True,,,,,,

- a lot of people try to rush this game and then fail and cry about it and don't understand the fact that this game is needed to take slowly you have to breath everything and play as if you are in the game yourself only then you will really enjoy the game,,,,,True,,,,,,
-the music oh my god the music is so beautiful and doesn't feel out of place it really sets you in that wild west time,,,,,True,,,,,,

Just being a cowboy\, hanging out with your horse.But boy\, is the control issue annoying. It is\, unfortunately\, something that is unavoidable in lowering the score.The plot\, without spoiling anything\, is reasonable\, but the writing didn't grab me. A great deal of the voice acting\, too. I'd put the writing on a par with GTA V\, as in \""not brilliant\, but will keep Hollywood fans amused.\""I haven't played online\, because GTA:O in the end just put me off Rockstar's ethic when it comes to online games now.Look. I enjoyed it. I played it through. I'm still messing about with it now. Will it have longevity? I don't know. It's big\, but the clanky controls are a real problem. DLC would help\, but the refusal to put such in GTA V suggests to me that Rockstar will rather pump everything into online if they think it'll make them even richer (will there be a Cowboy Card? Who knows?)\, but I'm hearing that basic items are ludicrously expensive in the online game\, so I can be forgiven for being a bit cynical on that score.It is a visual masterpiece (the weather effects are truly stunning\, I like the hair and beard growing idea\, like Witcher 3 had\, I find games are getting better and better at reproducing nature since the early days of videogames - I'm an old guy\, so I remember when 8-bit was the height of graphics technology) and while all of this is beautiful\, and I quite like just meandering about\, I just wish more time that was put into\, say morphing horse testicle technology (nope\, not a joke\, your big fellers spuds will shrink in the cold) was put into writing\, characterisation\, and making the controls smoother.But this old cowboy is rambling a bit. It's fun. Many people clearly enjoy it and are prepared to overlook its faults for its strengths.You know what? I'd play it just for the horses. They're worth the price of admission alone.TL;DR:- Good plot\, could have done with better writing though.- Very pretty. One of the prettiest games I've seen on a console.- The nature effects are magnificent.- The controls are at times frustrating and the general interface can be an issue.- There are bugs\, according to others\, but I've yet to encounter many.- Some of the voice acting is a little corny.- Some of the characterisation is a bit hamfisted.- Where's my damn poncho\, guys?… Expand",True,0.27236435,0.015350811,0.07508347,0.10294484,0.20262444,0.027688526

You are given everything you need from the beginning and do not develop after this point. All the weapons are essentially the same and the upgrades are extremely limited. There is little to no point in doing anything. No point in doing any of the side activities as there are no decent rewards that make the game any more enjoyable. Where are the special weapons? Perks? Infinite ammo? Enhanced abilities? Anything at all besides slightly increased cores which are meaningless seeing as you have a thousand healing items on you at all times anyway. Besides advancing the story there is no reason to invest time into this game\, it simply disappears down a black hole. When you can have the exact same experience with a game that you can have watching it on YouTube\, you know something is very wrong.Another personal gripe is the lack of enemy variety. It's only ever guys with guns and a couple of wild animals. I get that it is wild west realism but there is no requirement to approach any situation differently. All shootouts always play out in the same way (and the shooting is horrible). Where are the heavy guys or wagons with Gatling guns or steam powered giant spiders? It's all just so tedious and uninspired.Other people have already written about the multitude of things wrong with this game better than I ever could so I will conclude with this: RDR2 is the gaming equivalent of apple Hubba bubba.

WOW.Rockstar Games have made a true masterpiece\, the main character Arthur Morgan is definitely my all time favourite video-game charterer.The amount of detail that has been put into this game is incredible\, the visuals are breathtaking despite playing this since October. Like everywhere you go\, there is always small details.Now\, I would like to discuss the AI. I'm a long time GTA V player on PC\, the AI in V was terrible but Rockstar have really put in a lot effort into the AI in Red Dead Redemption 2. Also\, they have really done outstanding job for the weather!I think Red Dead Redemption 2 definitely deserved Game of The Year in 2018\, although God of War was an outstanding game!Many reviews from here complain about the prologue and the controls\, well.. the prologue lasts about for two hours\, it gives you a taste to what to expect in the story and gives you time to learn the controls. Now I have no issue with the controls what so ever\, although sometimes it can feel clunky while in major shoot outs.Now\, Red Dead Online... I'm not impressed with it. There's literately nothing to do\, I hope Rockstar will improve the mode in the near future. They definitely need to add a ton of content to the mode\, but at the end of the day they are calling the mode a BETA in the meantime..So\, the technical details. I played Red Dead Redemption 2 on PlayStation 4 Pro. There is one big downside playing it on the Pro\, Rockstar has implemented some weird checkerborad resolution which is resulting the game to look blurry but the frame-rate is amazing. I haven't experienced any major frame drops.That's all I have to say about Red Dead Redemption 2. I personally think this is the best game I have played this generation and I hope we will see a port for the next PlayStation and Xbox.

I can only imagine the amount of research that went into designing the world and wildlife in this game.I give this game a good\, solid 9. This review applies to the story mode only.A vast\, beautiful\, and imaginative open world\, filled with colorful characters. Deep emotional story with funny\, quirky\, unusual\, scary\, and sometimes downright bizarre side missions and random encounters. I can only imagine the amount of research that went into designing the world and wildlife in this game. From the way animals move\, the seasons\, the dynamic weather system and time of day events\, this game's world is an absolute masterpiece.  Good or bad\, harmful or helpful actions influence the way NPCs react to the player and their dialog as well.. This rating system also influences some cutscenes and appearance of side missions.There is a lot of different animals (178) in this game which the player can hunt; the pelts and other body parts being used to craft special gear and clothing\, or can simply be sold for money. Some players (like myself) enjoy grindy games. This one is a winner as far as that goes. R* did a great job immersing the player in the experience and getting the player emotionally invested in the main character.This game is a work of art but it isn't for everyone. There is quite a lot of time spent in which the action moves rather slowly. I don't view this as a bad thing. It is simply that the player needs to realize that this isn't the action-packed\, fast paced game that GTA5 was.The reason why I don't give this a 10 is that there are some issues. There's issues with every game but the issues in this one seem to be ones that the devs could've and should've fixed. For example\, the button and menu layouts are not very intuitive. In fact\, they are counter-intuitive. You may be confused as hell the first couple hours. The removal of fast travel is another con. It's quite the burden when it takes 10 minutes to go from one place to another. The map is gigantic. Seriously freakin huge. We should've had the fast travel option earlier in the game\, and should have been able to do it from a campfire like in RDR1. I understand why they didn't do this. I assume it is because they want the player to run into the myriad of random encounters. But that isn't fair to the players that just want to complete the story and not much else. The players that are going to explore are going to anyway\, whether there's expanded fast travel or not.There's also far too many immersion breaking glitches. They are minor ones but they still matter. But I blame that on the game developing climate of today which seems to be \""release now\, patch later\"". But honestly\, I expect more from R*\, especially with the amount of work put into this game.Other than the small issues\, the game overall is amazing. Once you get used to the controls and the menu\, it is fantastic. It's not for everyone. Some players won't like it because it takes time to get into. The beginning is rather slow as well. Some people like balls to the walls\, non-stop action and this game doesn't offer that. If you are doubtful\, you should wait for the price to drop.… Expand",True,0.048842013,0.0036239624,0.011987305,0.018967867,0.049928714,0.012647836

The graphics are absolutely stunning\, some of the best you’ll see in any game. Now that we’ve got graphics out of the way\, let’s get on to what counts most: gameplay1: +The gameplay is incredibly realistic and immersive. You will literally feel like you’re actually living in the world. There is a mechanic for EVERYTHING; from picking up canned pears to brushing your horse to fishing and hunting. There is an animation for everything you do and they are incredibly realistic and well done. Why am I mentioning this?- it leads to extremely slow and sometimes very tedious gameplay. When you explore and loot a house\, you have to sit through every animation whether that’s opening a drawer or searching the chimney. Everything has an animation and it can get very tedious.+Gun play is great\, I have no complaints with fire fights. Again\, you have to clean and maintain your guns which you guessed it\, more animations that can get a bit tedious.+Maintaining your character: As you play through RDR2\, you’ll have to eat food\, smoke cigarettes\, drink whiskey\, etc. to maintain your “cores.” You have one for you health\, one for stamina and one for “dead eye.” This was an aspect of the game I loved\, if you eat too little\, your character becomes underweight\, eat too much and he becomes overweight. If you don’t maintain your cores\, then your character and gameplay will suffer.-Some May not like this aspect of the game and just want to play the game. This is a complaint I’ve heard\, so I’m listing it here even though I thought it was a great addition.Story:+The story is awesome\, very engaging and you will grow to really care about the characters.-The story missions are very linear and scripted. They essentially just tell you what you are going to do\, you don’t make hardly any of your own decisions to impact the mission. Start at point A\, go to point B\, do what the game tells you\, then end of mission. Almost more like a movie. I will say that the story missions are fun however\, I’d just like more freedom.Controls: I put this separate to gameplay simply because I forgot to include it earlier. Whoops.+The character movement is extremely realistic\, very fluid and lifelike.-The controls can be very clunky. Because of the realism\, it can annoying to position your character to pick something up or to sneak up on an enemy. Like other Rockstar games\, you have to hold X/A to run. I just don’t understand this mechanic\, it’s a video game\, not real life\, I don’t want to hold X every time I want my character to run. Otherwise he walks at a slow pace. This is a pet peeve of mine\, I want my character to jog when I push the analog stick forward\, not also have to hold X\, it’s just an annoying mechanic.All in all\, the game is very good and Rockstar deserves praise\, but there is no way this game is a 97 out of 100.

The sound design of RDR2 is pretty well done\, and the music incorporation is done incredibly well. I am a sucker for good music in video games and the few moments where music is at the forefront are among my favorite parts of the game. My biggest gripe with the game is travel\, although it is immersive to ride your horse everywhere\, it does become quite tedious and boring after a while. This problem is solved though when you discover the fast travel map in your camp and learn to use stagecoaches and trains. Combat/gameplay are fun enough and immerse you into the world even further.

And I'm in absolutely blown away. Never has a game had this impact on me.The amount of detail put in the world is unprecedented\, the story and character development is absolutely amazing.The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is so beautiful\, sprawling with detail. The sights are jaw-dropping and the people and wildlife in the game is so well-made\, that I actually often felt like I was in the US in 1899. Everything in the game has a purpose\, the people in the towns and farms live their everyday life and can all be interacted with in several ways. The animals behave realistically in a way\, where I often caught myself just studying their behaviour. And the world itself is just so interesting\, detailed and beautiful with so much to see and do.The story follows Arthur Morgan and the Van Der Linde gang and goes into detail with their lives in camp\, their struggles to stay \""free\"" and independent in an industrialising world\, where there is no more room for the likes of outlaws. All the characters are deep and interesting\, and it is possible to get to know all of them very well\, should you so desire. And the end of the game\, I felt I knew all the characters\, and I was deeply moved by how the story developed.I do not want to get much more into much detail about the different aspects of the game.Red Dead Redemption 2 is a very mature\, slow-paced and in many ways realistic experience\, which may not appeal to all types of players. But I promise you\, if you give it a chance\, this is a game like no other\, with more depth than any other when it comes to the story\, the world and the characters than any other game. The way alle these thing are put together made the game absolutely flawless for me.This is the best videogame ever made.

There had been a handful of console exclusives over the years that looked interesting to me\, but I could take them or leave them. Red Dead 2 was the exception. I bought a PS4I switched to PC gaming several years ago and never really looked back\, except for one time a couple of years ago when I felt compelled to replay the first Red Dead Redemption and had to dust of my old PS3 to do it. There had been a handful of console exclusives over the years that looked interesting to me\, but I could take them or leave them. Red Dead 2 was the exception. I bought a PS4 to play this game.Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of open world games. I've probably logged the most hours of anything I've ever played on one of Bethesda's many sprawling open world games\, I played Breath of the Wild from start to finish\, the last few Assassins Creed games\, I tend to love the Far Cry series and I've liked most of the GTAs (particularly GTA5). This game was probably made for people like me and the high rating I gave it probably speaks to that fact.It's difficult for me to articulate just how different RDR2 feels to any of what came before... even the first RDR. On the face of things\, the many activities you can participate in in the world of Red Dead aren't all that different from the things you could do in\, say\, Far Cry 5. You can hunt\, you can go fishing\, you can wander off in basically any direction and get yourself into trouble you're not really equipped to deal with yet. And much like with its sister (mother?) series GTA\, you're never short on something to do\, or strangers and weirdos to do them with. And yet... it is different.There's something slower about it\, I feel like the game isn't constantly trying to entertain me with exciting stimuli and somehow this manages to be a good thing. Around 70% of the game seems to involve genuinely peaceful strolls and rides through idyllic simulated countryside\, which only serves to make the action sequences stand out all the more.This is largely achieved by imposing limitations on the gamer that we aren't used to. Gamers and fans of GTA/RDR have come to expect certain things\, like the ability to fast travel easily\, the ability to store literally anything\, big or small\, in a Tardis-like pocket dimension hidden in a bag or satchel and various other unrealistic luxuries that this game withholds from you. OK\, Arthur's satchel can still hold a hell of a lot\, but you have to store all of your animal pelts and carcasses on your horse's back\, where there is limited room. And sure\, you can take a carriage from one town to another\, or fast travel from your camp (after upgrading it)\, but you'll always have to ride back to your camp every time. Which is often. if you like hunting (I do) and you need to make room for more fresh kills\, you have to drop the carcasses off with Pearson (the camp chef)\, or cart the larger skins all the way out to the Canadian Trapper before you can kill and skin more like it. This should be tedious. Somehow it isn't. Somehow the act of repeating these patterns of riding out\, hunting\, fishing\, trading and returning to the camp winds up being a quite meditative process.I mentioned that I like hunting sims. It's a weird thing\, I don't hunt\, I never have\, I have no desire to\, but any game that includes a decent hunting sim seems to be improved by it\, the more realistic the better. Well... RDR2 has the most vivid and visceral hunting sim I've ever seen. It takes a little getting used to (especially when you have to put an animal out of its misery\, because you failed to kill it right the first time)\, but this is a big part of what makes the world feel so real.The small towns and cities are also beautifully realized. Saint Denis especially seems to be a fantastic period recreation of my favourite American city (New Orleans) and I enjoyed those parts of the game that were set there immensely.As for the story... if you've seen Netflix's Ballad of Buster Scruggs and you liked it\, then this is probably going to work for you. I really loved it. I won't go into spoilers here\, but I really enjoyed getting to know all of the gang members and embarking on these big\, chaotic missions that disrupt the order of these towns and cities\, or that peaceful countryside I just spent so long rattling on about.Like many RDR fans\, I was hoping I'd get to play as John Marston again and was a little leery of his replacement 'Arthur Morgan'\, especially since John is present at the outset of the game as an NPC gang member. It took a little while\, but Arthur really grew on me and by the end I think I wound up liking him more than John (the giant mustache I'd spent the whole game cultivating definitely helped).All in all\, this might be my favourite game of the past decade. It was well worth buying the console to play it.… Expand",True,0.1013248,0.00579834,0.02238941,0.024511116,0.07870171,0.020091362

I was seriously thinking about buying the most expensive special deluxe version with all the online bonuses etc. That would be HUGE mistake...Thank god I ended up with base disc version of the game\, and I already sold it...First 15 hours I was terribly annoyed tiresomely trying to get used to steering\, painfully slow animations and lack of any reasonableI was so hyped for this game... I was seriously thinking about buying the most expensive special deluxe version with all the online bonuses etc. That would be HUGE mistake...Thank god I ended up with base disc version of the game\, and I already sold it...First 15 hours I was terribly annoyed tiresomely trying to get used to steering\, painfully slow animations and lack of any reasonable combat system\, non working cover system etc.The game is victim to success of GTA series. Not much risk is taken\, same schemes are visible here.Which means broken exaggerated auto aim\, strictly scripted missions\, large parts of game being based on listening to all kinds of conversations during boring journeys etc\, but unfortunately also clumsy movement and animations of main protagonist. So\, while you expect engaging combat and some action\, you have to go through long minutes of talking. Over and over. Later on\, its getting really painful to see that your next mission is on the other side of the map and you will spend 10 minutes to get there... Sure\, there is some kind of fast travel system\, but its broken\, not well implemented\, because it requires you to find the carriage\, (and it does not work at nights) or going to your camp... so as well you may go with your horse instead of the chore of figuring this broken fast travel system.My god\, this game mechanics were so fun in the beggining\, lets say GTA3. By that times it did not matter how you complete your mission as long as the main objective is complete. Now its strictly scripted. You want to collect some loot during the fight? Too bad for you game will not let you\, it rushes you to be somewhere else. No fun at all.There is cinematic camera during the travel so you do not have to steer your horse. Pity there is no cinematic camera for the missions with auto completion system. There is more to watch and listen than to play\, so it would definitely make some sense.Other games are often criticized for dull combat. Professional reviewers does not see the problem with RDR2 being one-trick game. Dead eye. I did use it in literally every gunfight in this game\, because game let me. No challenge at all\, except meeting script requirements. No single boss fight\, one shot kills. Realistic? Rather dull.I tried to play online\, but it is terrible chaotic mess of a game. Autoaim everywhere\, kids thinking they got skills autoaiming everybody\, one headshot kills and all this ever present feeling of flat mechanics. I did not have the patience to figure it out why I can not shoot some players\, while other can one shot kill me.Back to single player mode\, they even cut out the fun of the ever forgiving system of careless rampage that was present in every GTA game. This is another flawed design choice. It makes no sense in robbing anyone\, because what you rob you will have to pay back to reset your wanted level. My god\, who came with these terrible ideas? You dressed the face mask and different outfit\, yet everyone recognize you instantly and put bounty on your head. How realistic is this??? XIX century police used cell phones??? This could be so much fun robbing trains all over again... Seeing maybe stronger security consecutive time we try to rob... What a waste!!!Let alone chores of taking some extremely boring activities\, washing\, eating working etc\, you can skip it entirely.So why 6/10 not less? Because of so much work put in detailed graphics\, huge world\, nice lore with all that secrets. At some point It was so fun just to go fishing\, hunting\, doing some sidemissions etc. But by the way main story treats you\, it was all destroyed. Overall\, it is sad game\, knowing soon they will all die... After finishing campaing I was not motivated to do anything else\, as it seem pointless to me.Credits goes for the best game tune in recent years which is Fire in Your Eyes\, it really moved me in a way I would never expect from this game. I will remember this game mainly because of the credit scene of Arthur's future-ex girlfriend visiting his grave... Somehow it hit me really hard to be honest.By the way\, I now see why first RDR game started off where RDR2 ends. If the story timeline was right\, and Marston's game was second one\, it would be way too obvious.Anyway I will never forgive so called proffesional reviewers to rate this game so high. Real value is reflected rather by user scores.Once again it seems that its is easier to put infinite resources on the game world\, on beautiful graphics\, never ending camp interactions\, countless encounters and characters\, than it is to build engaging and addictive game mechanics. We miss more Miyamotos in the industry.At minimum\, Dan and Sam please at least hire some decent mechanics engineer\, the one from\, lets say Uncharted series\, would make your game to be remembered forever.I really hope next GTA you will rebuild mechanics from scratch\, but seeing kind of money you earn on this\, hope may turn out to be again fool's mother...… Expand",True,0.23523538,0.017674843,0.023595277,0.053205602,0.1631077,0.022163315

(PSProHaving played and enjoyed Red Dead Redemption\, I assumed I would enjoy Red Dead Redemption 2.  Even so\, it surprised me with just how swiftly it ascended through my top 10\, oftentimes shredding the competition\, to rest in the second spot of said top 10.This game really is a marvel\, and I must've thought to myself dozens of times 'how did Rockstar pull this off on console?' (PSPro user).  Between environmental details\, LoD\, draw distance\, animations\, incredibly low pop-in\, etc.\, it's at times difficult to fathom.Gameplay-wise\, my biggest skepticism pre-release was the sim-like aspects I kept hearing about - from maintaining your health and cleanliness\, to your horse's health and cleanliness\, to keeping watch on food going bad\, keeping your weight in a good range\, keeping your guns cleaned\, and the list goes on.  Thankfully I found none of these things detracted from the main focus of the game even a bit.  I could've spent eons hunting\, fishing\, and doing other non-mission activities if I chose\, but only doing them sparingly was enough to satisfy both me and the game's requirements.Missions\, be they main\, side\, or 'pop-up'\, I found to be excellent probably 90% of the time\, with the remaining 10% being just fine.  The writing in particular\, as well as the voice acting and performance capture\, all play enormous roles in making it all so interesting.  The music surrounding numerous interactions and set pieces is spot-on\, fantastic\, with my only complaints being I wish I'd heard more of it when outside of these times\, and why isn't the soundtrack released yet?!Arthur as the player-character is so well done\, with Rockstar finding the sweet spot between pre-defined character and blank slate that other games struggle with.  His character arc is told wonderfully\, with the addition of his journal in game offering a fair amount of insight into his tale as the story rolls on.I'd say this game is often what you make of it.  You can hunt and fish\, play poker or other games\, explore constantly\, and do many things outside of outlaw-style activities if you so choose.  It isn't always robbin' and runnin'\, shoot-em-up\, action all the time\, but if you want that\, you can get pretty close...however\, in doing so\, I think you miss out on a lot of the immersion this game can bring.The game isn't without a few flaws\, of course...The controls are unintuitive and inconsistent\, which when you look at how much has been done in this game in every other area\, it's a shame this critical section was done so sloppy.  It took a good while for me to get used to them\, and even then...  You may have played some games where it seems you stare at the mini-map more than the wider world before you?  This can feel similar at times\, except rather than the mini-map\, it's staring at the bottom-right corner for which button to press\, because of the inconsistencies I mentioned (for an easy example\, looting bodies is triangle\, but looting items from a lockbox is square).Where combat is concerned\, it takes it fiddling with the settings a fair amount to feel right\, at least it did for me.  Once I got it there though\, I found it great.Lastly\, most missions and side-quests\, once you undertake one\, means you do it right then\, through to the end.  There's very little going round and collecting quests to then do at your fancy.  They are generally highly-scripted\, with little room for innovation on the player's part.  This didn't bother me that much\, honestly - it was more the peripheral things.  As an example\, my not wanting to move up in a shooting sequence because I could hit the enemies from where I was perfectly fine...but my gang member along on the mission wanted to\, and eventually they get far enough away I inadvertently 'abandon' them\, and have to restart the checkpoint.That's that...despite my complaints and pre-release skepticism\, as I said\, RDR2 has leapt to nigh the top of my list of games.

You really get a feel you're immersed in this world.-The graphics are stellar\, easily blow away anything else out there right now.-Arthur Morgan is a pretty cool character - humble\, yet still has a complex personality.Cons:-You've probably heard of the awful weapons wheel controls already - whoever thought this out should be reprimanded. You literally have to keep selecting the item/weapon you want after any major cut scene or deviance in the story. It doesn't sound like a big deal\, but when you have to do it multiple times every few minutes it just gets tedious.-The first few hours of game are very slow\, but it's mostly just to teach you the (sometimes dreadful) controls.-Online portion is a mess still\, let's hope they get it sorted!-Probably my biggest complaint with the game is the politically correct agenda they inserted into the story. Myself like many others play games to escape this sort of thing\, not be further subjected to it. Unfortunately Rockstar has also fallen victim to the PC agenda. You can see it a lot in the game\, how it's okay to shoot Caucasian men and how Caucasian men are the enemy\, yet there are almost no missions where you shoot a woman or a black man or a red man. In fact\, all of the missions involving black/natives make them out to be saints. And of course I'm sure you've heard about the feminist views in the game as well\, which is also pretty odd at times. I'm not a super political person but I do sense the game is trying to have an agenda at times. It doesn't allow you to go on the indian reserve and shoot anyone - but hey\, killing Southern Caucasians is alright. Yeah...not cool!But if you can look past the PC stuff and the weapons wheel issues\, the game is pretty solid and will keep you entertained for many a long evening.… Expand",True,0.08083374,0.0044441223,0.024198212,0.027605021,0.07223598,0.012958534

And on the other hand\, consumers were mixed\, with some agreeing with critics and others refusing to play after the opening hours. I can't rightfully agree with either camp\, as neither is wrong or right. Yes\, the game goes leaps and bounds ahead with open world game design in some aspects\, but also falls woefully short in even the most basic mechanics.To start\, movement is absolute crap. While on foot\, you can either run or walk\, pretty standard for games of this variety\,  walking is far too slow and running is for too fast. This problem rears its ugly head when in towns\, where walking across the street takes the better part of a day\, while running will have people stare at you like your a crazy man. But even though walking would have a snail outrun you\, walking into or even near an NPC will have you budge them out of the way or (god forbid) knock them over\, gaining you an instant wanted level and having everyone else around you run away screaming like you just killed him. In fact\, the wanted system causes way more problems than it's worth. Instead of it being like GTA or the previous Red Dead\, when you get a bounty\, the only way to get rid of it is to pay it off. That doesn't sound like the worst thing in the world\, until you realize it really is the only way\, even dying to the lawmen won't get rid of it. meaning you are HEAVILY discouraged from doing anything illegal lest you have to pay a lump sum or avoid the county for 2 weeks until they forget about you. While you can serve your sentence in jail\, you can only serve the sentence of small crimes such as assault. If you kill a person (intentionally or not) the police will not spare you. Even if someone attacks you in the street and you defend yourself\, the police will still try to arrest or kill you.Many critics praised the game especially for the attention to detail throughout the world without exception\, and to be fair\, it is incredible how much detail they've managed to include\, but here is where I have to stop being nice. Sure\, the detail is staggering... the first time you see it\, after that\, it doesn't impress\, in fact\, it hinders the user experience due to the commitment to realism in every action you take. Shop menus are no longer menus\, they're catalogs that you have to flip pages in\, slowing shopping to a crawl since you to wait for the 2 second animation of page flipping to finish before you can do anything. In the same vein\, (kinda) survival elements. The game has a weight mechanic now\, the more or less you eat\, the more or less you weigh\, how surprising. The problem occurs when your weight changes your health and stamina in positive or negative ways depending on your weight\, meaning if you don't eat 3 pieces of meat at a camp 3 times a day you fall too under-weight and all of your stats will drain even faster before needing to be refilled... with food. So why not just eat then? Well\, in order to get food (assuming you don't have any on you) is to hunt animal\, which animal you kill and skin will determine the meat you get. You can get stringy meat from small animals such as rabbits and squirrels\, or prime meat from large animals like bears and elk. Once you have the meat\, you need to make camp\, which takes about 20 seconds to load and be ready to use\, after which you cook the meat over the fire\, which take about 10 seconds\, and then eat it for 5 seconds. All of this for each piece until you think you've had enough\, which is hard to tell because the game doesn't tell you.In between all of these exciting adventures\, you'll be traveling the open world for much longer than you'd like to be\, by that I mean it takes 2-3 minutes to ride to the nearest town from where you leave the tutorial. To occasionally fill the empty space\, RockStar decided to add in random events\, ranging from a person in danger to robbers holding you up. These events can be quite entertaining from time to time and can offer a neat distraction.I noticed this site has a limited number of characters at this point so I'll finish the rest quickly.Horse riding is slow and unresponsive\, gun-play is the bare-essentials\, the story is... fine\,and the writing is good for the most part. Everything not mentioned is either done well  or not worth mentioning.From the sound of all this you may think I hate the game\, I don't\, I just don't understand how a game could spend 10 years in development and fail in so many basic mechanics\, leading me to believe that priorities were wrong from the beginning\, focusing on detail instead of gameplay.… Expand",True,0.20219094,0.010299683,0.04667538,0.061626412,0.12158839,0.02492592

The writing superb. The world\, ecosystems\, NPC's awesome.And yet the gameplay is absolutely horrendous. Here is why:- The control scheme. I think every sane person can agree it's pretty bad. Complicated\, unintuitive and inconsistent\, no point writing an essay about it.- The actual controls of your character. The animation is very\, very heavy. It's not realistic (unless Arthur is constantly drunk and drugged)\, it's impressive looking. While I'm okay with having running disabled in camp/certain situations why the hell can't I fast-walk outside the camp/buildings? The only three options available for the most of the game are: slow walk (you move even slower than NPC's)\, run and sprint. It's not immersive\, it's immersion breaking. The only choices I have is to walk so slowly\, my companions scream at me to hurry up and I can't effectively get anywhere or run which is way to fast to be immersive. The lack of fast walk outside the camp is just mind-boggling.- The mission structure is insane... ly bad. Missions consist mostly of walking/riding (read holding 1 button) while listening to dialogue. The rest of it is mediocre gunplay and heavily scripted events. Many people argue GTA followed the same principle (I don't like comparing these two very different series but for the sake of argument and mental exersise let's do this once) GTA missions indeed are structured comparably but driving cars in GTA is actually very engaging and one of the strongest points of the game (not to mention other means of transport such as helicopters\, planes\, bikes\, you name it). In RDR2 riding horses is cool\, but gets boring so very quickly the devs themselves decided to add a cinematic travel so you don't actually have to do it.- The scripting and autosaves are so bad\, they give me flashbacks to 2003. Most of the missions have you follow a very specific path. If you walk too far you failed. If you don't go to X in time\, you failed. You've fallen too far behind\, you failed. Et cetera\, et cetera. The game heavily punishes any kind of creativity\, it wants you to do exactly as you're told and see exactly what you're intended to see. In addition to that checkpoints are sometimes awful (one example is while sneaking to a certain place: if you get discovered at any point you have to restart and the checkpoint is... before a 5-minute carriage ride). The post is too long as it is so I won't give many examples\, but this is the first game in maybe 10 years where I've actually noticed a terrible checkpoint system.- No difficulty settings. While the gunplay is serviceable\, the lack of difficulty makes the shooting sequence tedious as hell. Arthur can literally eat a few shotgun rounds before he falls and has a slow-mo op deadeye ability pretty much always up. The only difficulty there is comes in the form of incredibly clunky controls that can ocassionally get you killed.These are my main gripes with the game. I think RDR2 is an amazing piece of entertainment that fails hard as a game. My final score so far would be somewhere between a 4 and a 9 out of 10. It honestly depends on what you want from the game. If you want any sense of challenge\, progress or mental exersise\, there is absolutely none to find here. If all you want is to chill\, take in the environment and watch a good story unfold this is the product for you.I've developed a love-hate relationship with RDR2 as I believe games should take advantage of the medium and use gameplay to enhance the experience and do things way outside the reach of the \""traditional\"" entertainment. That's why it irritates me to see a product so caught up in itself\, it forgot it's a game.If you've gone through this post this far\, I want to apologize for any weird grammar you had to go through.

Every time i look at this game it feels so real and really enhances immersion. The attention to detail\, the faces\, the horse's\, waterfalls\, snowy mountains and more. The games environments are varied and Rockstar has put so much effort into how this game looks it is incredible. The voice acting is great\, not only from the talented main cast but the random strangers in the world as well. The sounds of the world around you like crowded towns or the sounds of the nature and wildlife around you is incredibly detailed. The soundtrack is incredibly diverse and always feels perfect and is played at the right times. The story and its characters are easily the highlight of this experience. The beginning might be slow but the rest of the game is paced perfectly. The main game is long and creates a slower and more stretched out pacing that works to great effect and allows you to grow and understand each character. The world around you feels so real and detailed its incredible. Beggars in the street asking for money\, suffragettes protesting women's rights\, and even your own gang hanging around a campfire singing songs all add to this experience. The characters are all unique and have different relationships with each other. The main protagonist\, Arthur Morgan seems like a pretty average character at first but his development throughout the story and coming to know him better makes him one of the best protagonists in gaming history. The themes and lessons\, the way the society changes around you and does not accept outlaws any more\, the tension between characters and slowly setting everything up all for it to crumble down is amazing. One of the best written and in depth narratives i have ever experienced in any medium. The game-play however is more of a mixed bag. Movement feels a bit slow and the cover system is very finicky. The auto aim is very obnoxious and gives you no control in combat. The shooting either feels too accurate or not at all at times. However the sound and environments of the battles\, abilities like dead eye and dynamite and tomahawks and all the creative ways to take out enemies is great. Camp management and maintaining your health and weight and all the other role playing like mechanics are all welcomed and add a lot of depth and personalization. The game allows you to simulate a western world and immerse yourself. While most of the realistic mechanics work and are great\, horses and controlling them can be very frustrating. Story missions while great are kind of repetitive and mostly end in a shootout\, but some of them are really creative and change up things. Apart from the main story missions the game has a lot to see and do. Side missions and other things make up most of this game and all of it is top notch. The humor and wit of the side stories is incredible and there is so much to see and do. Random events and encounters add to the world as well. Sometimes these side activities are better than the main story missions. Mini games like poker and blackjack are fun and great ways to spend time\, fishing and hunting are great and the mechanics are really refined. This was a long review of mine but this is an even longer game. The game may not be perfect but what it gets right mostly outweighs it. This game is an incredible experience unlike any other.

Fortunately these options do not overwhelm the player\, but are instead revealed progressively\, allowing you to first master what is already there. After several hours spent with the game I was still constantly being surprised by a steady stream of new features and added complexity to pre-existing mechanics.All this depth\, however\, wouldn't be worth 2 cents if it wasn't for the incredibly high degree of fine tuning and polishment that went into the game.

I enjoy slow paced games like dark souls\, or strategy games like x-com where game's basically not moving forward unless you make a move\, but red dead redemption 2 is simply casual to the point it's offensive.When you make a truly big game like this\, when you put huge money into development\, you have to target it to the masses to make your investment pay off. The way it's done with RDR2\, is no different than hollywood block busters - you make a product that is visually impressive\, but in the most mediocre taste possible. Must be pretty\, must be easy\, must be for the masses. I don't mean to sound arrogant\, but true.Boring\, slow story\, awful quests. Sure - world is huge\, and you often have freedom as for order in which you want to do some quests. But once you start doing them\, they are very linear. Example. you'll ride 10 minutes to a place of a quest. You'll watch 2 minute cut scene. You will have to destroy some door/window than. the device to help you with that\, will be standing literally next to the door. The game is open\, but it tells you what to do constantly. You have freedom about where to go\, but no freedom of how to deal with things. A lot of quests will force you to do boring mini games. Example - lift up the wheel holding 'up'. Now roll the wheel holding left. Now push the wheel holding 'right'. Now hit the wheel few times to attach it by pressing x.Gameplay. Worst part of the game. Super casual\, slow and unresponsive. No skill required. No point hiding behind covers - your enemies will die of age before your character will roll his ass behind cover. Aim assistance is so strong by default\, that when aiming from behind a cover\, game often was pointing at the enemy I was not even aware of. Just automatically aiming at the enemy without any assistance from me. Shooting feels bad\, like in all rockstar games. Even worse than shooting\, is the movement. Moving your character feels like rolling a stone up the hill. When you're running and you stop all of sudden\, it takes your character around second to actually stop moving. Defenders of the game will justify it with realism but that's no argument. In reality if shot at\, I would run to the cover and drop on the ground in a blink of an eye\, In that game it takes forever. in  reality you wouldn't be able to take few gun shots on the chest\, and than just eat canned peach and be like new. You can't justify clunky mechanics with realism. The game doesn't even allow you to run in a lot of places\, for sake of 'realism'\, but it's super unrealistic in other places.Generally\, this game is divided into riding a horse\, talking and talking\, cut scenes\, poorly executed shooting\, and mini-games. If you like playing with toys\, you'll most likely enjoy that game. You can brew coffee\, wash every limb of your body separately\, pat your horse\, feed your horse\, brush your horse.

I've done 4 side quests. 2 of them\, were like this - one a way from one location to another\, I rode for like 5 minutes\, met a women who's horse died. I helped her to lift the horse (little game called 'lifting a horse' that is about pressing x button)\, and than rode her back to the town I was just coming from. I don't know what kind of people find this fun\, I don't. Other side quest was about chasing some animal\, that stole some bag from some dude (I'll spare you details to avoid spoilers).

79832,RDR2,2018-11-12,4.0,"Here's a brief description of one mission.Your mission is to rob a train. First step is to steal a wagon with an oil barrel on back\, which you are going to put on the railway and light on fire so the train will see it from far away and come to a stop. Then you can rob it.So you look at your mini map and it tells you where to go to steal the wagon. You ride your horse there. This takes 5 minutes. Real world time. Just riding a horse. Along a road you have gone up and down probably 20 times already doing various errands.The wagon is in an oil field where the workers shoot on sight. Because sometimes the game is realistic to a fault\, and then suddenly it's not. You jump the fence\, hop on the wagon\, get shot a few times -- doesn't matter\, you have at least 50 different healing items that restore full health pretty much at all times -- you repeatedly mash X to gallop away to safety. You ride for another 5 minutes to drop off the wagon where it's supposed to go. That was easy\, though it did take me three times because once you get close to the wagon area\, if you move away too far the mission fails. So my initial idea was to scope the place out\, then take cover on some high ground\, pick dudes off\, lose them in the woods when they come after me\, and then drop back into the oil field after drawing most of them out. But nope. So much for open world freedom.You ride another 5 minutes back to home base to tell home boy you done your job\, and he says \""cool man.\"" Then you have to complete another mission before you can continue. So you take a kid that talks like the worlds most generic child fishing\, and he say's it's boring\, and I wholeheartedly agree. Besides the boring nature of the game mechanic\, what does fishing do for you? It gives you more health. I already have more health items than I can carry. It's not worth enough to sell\, and I don't need money either. The only things to buy are clothing items\, everything else the game gives you anyway...So you do that stupid mission which\, start to finish\, will chew up twenty minutes in which you are basically doing nothing. Now\, back to the train robbery. So you ride back to where you stashed the wagon -- 5  minutes. Then you watch a cutscene\, then you got to ride with the gang to the ambush site. This is another 5 minute jaunt\, but this time you got the crew trying their durndest to tell side-splitting funnies\, but it's typical game dialogue that feels disjointed and unnatural -- like the voice actors recorded at separate places and times. And the dialogue can be ignored\, because it's just banter -- it doesn't build characters or move story\, it's just non-sense \""tough-guy\"" talk\, because everybody knows all tough-guy train robbers do is talk trash to each other constantly\, and especially before pulling off a big heist.Alright\, so now\, finally\, it's train robbin' time. You're ready to get all sweaty palmed and squinty eyed\, because you're here to do what you came to do. You've worked almost an hour doing monotonous crap to get to this point. The big dramatic train robbery! Now's the time when you don't mind that big\, drawn out cutscene with the tense chord and the beady eyes twitching and the trees drawing long shadows as the train blares it's horn with it's headlight coming round the corner... hell yeah\, you can feeeeel it coming...But wait.. something isn't right. Remember the oil wagon you were going to set on fire? Well\, they just put it on the tracks\, and hero character stands on top of it with his rifle. What? That wasn't the plan. And the corner the train is coming around clearly isn't far enough away to give the train time to stop... Why did I steal this wagon again?The other gangsters hide behind the trees\, and then real sudden like a generic action track starts up\, you get a real fast sweeping shot of the gang in the trees\, then the train comes and see's the wagon all of a sudden and just stops. No squeeling brakes\, no smoke plumes\, no dramatics -- nothing. Then there is a bunch of yelling\, and even though you are in charge of this heist somebody is hollering \""hey arthur\, come do this! Come do that!\"" So you try to hurry over\, but the game has locked running for right now\, so you have to walk slowly over to the guys shouting to hurry.You follow behind your bro who is holding a goodie bag and demanding people to point money inside. Every third person says \""no\"" and you press B when it tells you to punch them in the face. You can't do that or anything else until you are prompted to do so. So you do that for about a minute then the game tells you to go help somebody else. This time bad guys jump into the scene\, you hold the trigger which auto-aims onto anybody on the screen\, and you pull the other trigger to shoot them. You do that for ten minutes\, then you go on another 10 minute horse ride. Mission over. What do you get for all of that? Money that you don't need.I cannot recall a more poorly designed AAA game than this.… Expand",True,0.2854835,0.015931819,0.04796442,0.110259406,0.14313951,0.122295745

It actually HAS that confidence. And it delivers. This is the greatest video game narrative ever written. The choice to make it a prequel and tie it back to John Marston’s old days in the Dutch Van Der Linde Gang is hands down the BEST aspect of this game. It harkens back to characters you love\, so you instantly have that connection and uses that context to establish new characters you’ll know and love as well. Arthur Morgan’s struggle with morality and the inevitable outcome of his actions is one of the most engaging gaming stories ever told and is a great successor to John Marston’s story which was also brilliant.I **** loved this game and I think it’s smart that Rockstar are investing in their new IPs instead of just hashing out another GTA (which would’ve been the obvious financial decision). But Rockstar isn’t like that. They’re not EA. They have actual integrity and want to be remembered for their resonance\, quality and hard work rather than just taking the easy decision.Red Dead Redemption 2 is proof of that.Now make L.A Noire 2\, PLEASE!… Expand",True,0.085582085,0.0063323975,0.018872296,0.0233509,0.07805514,0.020436687

My most remembered case was a woman charging me with a knife while i was trying to lasso her. Instant kill. I reload and do it again\, this time pressing block when she attacks. Instant kill. Last time\, i got pissed off and tried to punch her in her face\, and my character sidestepped her\, tripping and disarming her. Bad design.The UGLY:The bounty system is the worst i've ever seen in a game. The idea is cool\, and when it works\, it's amazing. You do a crime\, someone sees you and they report you to the law\, you can stop them by either threatening or killing them. Sounds good\, right? Problem is\, say you kill a guy on a road\, you leave and someone stumbles onto the corpse. he then tells the law that he found a body and you INSTANTLY get a bounty on you. Despite being long gone when anyone showed up\, despite never been seen there. Another example\, you try to rob a train\, you go there\, start taking out the guards\, having stopped the train in the middle of noware. Suddenly\, there's lawmen there\, having had the \""Crime reported\"" as the games calls it. You get a bounty\, roughly 200-300 dollars\, for earning maybe 80. Here comes the worst part though. The only way to get ridd of a bounty is for you to pay it off. So\, you rob a train\, you get 200 dollars bounty and 80 dollars of loot\, that's a loss of 120 dollars. It doesn't make sense. Even worse\, is that if you have a bounty\, you get lawmen or bounty hunters looking for you. If they kill you\, they take some of your money (seems to be around 10%)\, you wake up.... and you still have the bounty. Say that you kill the lawmen or hunters? Well\, your bounty goes up for each you kill\, even if you kill every single one\, so no one can report it back to them. As i said\, the bounty system is the worst ever made.

It is definitely an above average game\, and the graphics are top notch and the game world seems very well crafted. However\, especially after the delays I definitely expected a lot more. The story is slow\, but that doesn't bother me. However\, the gameplay itself lacks diversity and much of the time you feel that you are just doing the same thing over and over. What this does is turn what is a slow\, but great story into a tedious one that you just wish would hurry up... because you know that you are only going to see some slightly new stuff from time-to-time. Another issue I have with this is that in most aspects it has not improved on the first game in the series. It feels almost like a massive DLC than a new game. This isn't always a bad thing\, but in the case of RDR2 I feel like the developers put all of their eggs in one basket (graphics and game world) and pretty much just winged it for the rest\, or rushed through it. What I will say is that I do like the survival aspects in the game\, and wish they were even more robust. The combat is standard run-of-the-mill\, but not bad... just nothing special and no real skill required for it.  Two huge negatives to the combat is this game has auto aim functionality so you don't have to actually aim (thankfully you can turn it off)\, and it has slow mode allowing you to slow down time for an advantage. Completely lame garbage \""features\"" and I wish these would get taken out of all games\, even MMO's. I've run into a good amount of bugs. Some of the bugs from RDR 1 I tested and a few still exist. Meanwhile some new bugs have popped up. I've noticed a few of the AI doing a weird sliding through mid air. Another example of one of these bugs is I shot one of the AI and they just froze in place\, meanwhile they were also not injured or killed by the bullet. You will especially notice bugs during the train heist. One more bug I'd like to mention is that while riding a course your character gets stuck in the holstering animation sometimes\, and he can't stop pulling his gun out and back in. The sounds are definitely pretty good and I think the music is very immersive.I bought mine for $60. Was it worth this price? Definitely not\, in fact I am feeling buyer's remorse. I'd say it's something closer to a $40 game.People who give this game a 10 have low standards\, and people who give this game a 0 are simply trolls. It's definitely an above average game\, and it might even be technically \""game of the year\,\"" but that's not really saying much in 2018. And it's definitely not deserving of any ratings below a 5. I could see someone giving this game a 5 in some circumstances. But 0's? 1's? 2's?

Instead\, Read Dead Redemption 2 takes itself too seriously. Cinematic for the sake of cinema. It begs the question: In all ofIn trying to create a deep world\, Rockstar has outdone itself in the worst possible way. At its surface\, the game appears to have everything promised to fulfill a glorious sequel to Read Dead Redemption: beautiful landscape\, rich lore\, and endless unscripted fun. Instead\, Read Dead Redemption 2 takes itself too seriously. Cinematic for the sake of cinema. It begs the question: In all of the countless hours it took to create this game\, did anyone bother to actually play it? Games\, after all\, are supposed to be play.The controls of RDR2 may be the biggest surprise that I have experienced so far. If you think you are familiar with Rockstar controls after playing GTA V (and prior releases)\, think again. There is a lack of intuitiveness that can result in undesired consequences. In order to compensate for the overly complex controls that would be cumbersome\, if not impossible\, for one to fully grasp\, there is an overlay that details different button actions.The potential issues with controls are amplified by relatively slow and arduous animations. At times\, you are restricted in motion (i.e. unable to run\, unable to pull out gun\, etc.) and it is not clear when/why this occurs. There are numerous instances where the game resets (weapons\, horse hitch location\, etc.) that result in the player needing to constantly micro-manage inventory and re-adjust.The world is stunning at first glance. Graphically it may represent the peak capability of this console generation. The old adage “looks aren’t everything” comes to mind\, because while the beauty will surely captivate you for hours\, like all things it will begin to lose its charm in due time. The trees and the shadows cast from them are glorious — until your horse runs into them after you say ‘hello mister’ to a passing stranger and the camera’s re-direction causes you to instantly veer in the new direction. Try saying ‘hello’ to folk in town and see how straight you can maintain your horse. In stark contrast\, consider Until Dawn\, which maintained directional input through camera cuts\, that is until a player stopped input all together\, triggering the game to smartly re-adjust to the new orientation on the fly.It is a cumulation of oversights and questionable development choices that undermine a monumental creation. Just how many hours is a player expected to spend in doing mundane tasks such as shaving\, bathing\, and brushing the horse. How many times must you pick up your hat? How many times must you watch the same looting animation? Or eat the same meal (stew) at the same interval (god forbid you have seconds).The bounty system discourages\, or even prevents\, players from engaging in criminal activity. Yes\, you are in a criminal gang. No\, you may not gain money from doing things a gang typically does. Take for instance\, looting a train. You may earn $100 from looting it. But you will have lost $200+ in the growing bounty that you must pay. Red Dead Redemption 2 takes it one step further than student loan debt in the U.S. - your bounty will actually carry through past your own demise - It only is resolved once the debt has been paid in full. The unbalance between reward & risk creates a sense of morality that Rockstar intents to bestow upon its gamers. Pick the role of noble Arthur\, lest you find yourself a poor destitute as you bounce between cities getting killed or hauled away by bounty hunters.High on the heels of success in GTA V Online\, Rockstar intends to re-capturing the elusive lightning in the bottle of substantial micro-transaction purchases on the backs of loyal gamers. Despite its lack of availability upon launch\, make no mistake\, this feature will surely become a primary focus for Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two Interactive. After all\, there are executives with a fiduciary responsibility\, and shareholders that want a return. The absence of any “Season Pass” or bundled DLC at a flat rate is striking considering the Ultimate version comes in at $99 MSRP.Ultimately\, Red Dead Redemption 2 falls flat. It fails the simple test of: Is it fun? For those willing to overlook the numerous frustrations that could have easily been avoided\, there lies an open-world Cowboy Western genre with no other competition in sight. For an average gamer looking for play\, consider watching a Western movie\, reading a Western book — you will have saved yourself 50 hours from a cinematic horse simulator\, complete with a compelling cast & environment\, and crippled gameplay mechanics.… Expand",True,0.19504376,0.008811951,0.031464707,0.06494803,0.10301965,0.030278467

I played it a few months ago during my hype and anticipation for this game\, and it has still held up incredibly well and was an absolute blast\, I have probably beaten it 4-5 times total and have enjoyed it every time. Needless to say\, I was hyped for RD2\, and picked it up on opening night\, planning to lose many hours to this game.Well\, that didn't happen. This is the most disappointing game that I have ever played.Let me start off by saying that the production values\, plot\, voice acting\, and environments are phenomenal. The world is truly beautiful\, and attention to detail exceptional. The plot and characters are mostly excellent as well.But my lord\, the gameplay is bad. The control scheme is horrific and extremely outdated\, where you still have to smash X to run instead of clicking L3. There is an input lag of one to a few seconds\, so you rarely shoot or reload in the way you want to. Taking cover often doesn't work or happen\, resulting in you potentially climbing over objects instead. Picking up guns\, clothing\, or items have three different buttons\, resulting in frequent confusion. Knowing which weapons you have on you\, switching weapons\, and trying to use supplies buried in menus is often confusing.Arthur runs slowly\, and your horse is also slow.Moving around your camp is super slow\, and the camp system is not good or cool at all\, the bond between you and your gang is not well established. The systems shown in tutorials are not often how the game actually works (for example\, you hunt and bring a live deer to a guy at your camp in a tutorial\, but this is not how you give the guy hunted animals going forward). I would spend upwards of 20 minutes walking because you can't call your horse if it is too far away.Interacting with the world around you is also super slow\, it can take up to 10 seconds to examine items around you\, and you will often be tasked with searching for every item in an entire building.And\, accidentally committing crimes is WAY too easy. A drunk guy stumbles in front of your horse and you run him over: the whole town starts shooting at you\, wanted level is $20\, have to surrender outside of town. Abysmal. Certain items can only be sold at certain shops\, resulting in you spending too much time running to each different shop.This game is just a shame. In the original Red Dead Redemption\, the combat was quick and responsive\, the world around you had attention to detail\, intense gunfights\, the ability to travel quickly\, and selling all of your items at most shops. RD2 adds much more nuances and systems to create a more realistic experience\, but this harms the experience mightily\, resulting in slower gameplay all around: movement\, combat\, interaction\, exploration. It is a video game\, I understand creating a time period environment\, but is realism the only thing that matters?!Sorry for my long review\, I was just more excited for this game than any other in a very long time\, probably none since Zelda BotW\, and as I mentioned\, the original is my favorite game of all time. But this game is flat out boring and slow\, and I do not understand the critic review\, perhaps the hype has them inclined to leave a positive review??

79925,RDR2,2018-11-10,7.0,"I'll start off by saying it's impossible to take game reviewers serious these days. Who are these people? A game rated at 97 should be so groundbreaking and awesome - so flawless and polished - whoever made it deserves to be deified. At that rating we're talking wonders of the world - something only the gods could do better - an event of historical proportions.And let's face it - RedI'll start off by saying it's impossible to take game reviewers serious these days. Who are these people? A game rated at 97 should be so groundbreaking and awesome - so flawless and polished - whoever made it deserves to be deified. At that rating we're talking wonders of the world - something only the gods could do better - an event of historical proportions.And let's face it - Red Dead Redemption 2 does not deliver that quality. It's neither groundbraking\, flawless or polished - and even though certain aspects of it does cross the border to what should be considered awesome others again falls miserably short of even seeing that border.Graphics are stunning\, world is rich on content and the general atmosphere really sucked me in. Attention to details is almost unparalleled. The story is predictable and feels a bit forced - some turn of events simply doesn't make sense and the characters turn either dumb or genius according to what's convenient in furthering the storyline - and it's also quite quite static.All in all it's not very \""organic\"" nor does it allow for the player to interact with it in any profound ways.But despite not being the pinnacle of penmanship nor deeply influenced by the player's decisions - it did entertain me and in addition to falling in love with the world itself I also ended up becoming invested in the characters and even sad to see some of them go.Rockstar is - as always - brilliant in creating the framework of a truly inspired game. Rockstar is also however - as always and unfortunately - mediocre at best when it comes to everything else.Gameplay suffers profoundly in this game. The controls are clumsy and bad - needlessly hard to navigate\, often unresponsive - and both movement as well as combat are clunky to say the least and altso unimaginative.  Something youd expect from a game made ten years ago - not a more recent AAA-Production.It lacks anything even resembling flow and also falls short in terms of user friendliness. Gunplay is pretty much autoaim and instant headshot - melee is simply mashing two buttons in accordance to animation and the mechanics for fishing actually made my hands go numb.And even though the story is good enough (though not as brilliant as many would argue) - the missions are unrewarding tours. In fact - the way they're played out - you hardly get to influence them at all as the game itself pushes you down certain paths and makes most decisions for you.They're so overly-scripted your actions and options constantly gets limited to a point where you might as well put the controller on the table and simply watch a movie. Most of the time you just follow character X through points A-Z then either click the objects he tells you to click or kill whomever he needs you to kill before being rewarded with a cutscene. It feels more like a tutorial that never ends than an actual game - and often it even dictates where you're allowed to move and at which pace or whether or not you're allowed to have your guns ready.Even your weapon setup is affected. Went through a lot of trouble choosing and prepping the desired weapons pre-mission? Tough luck as this game will revert your choices to what it wants you to use during the first cutscene (even though the weapons it forces upon you are of the same type as the ones you'd prefer).This to me was maybe my biggest nuisance - as I felt this game was treating me like an idiot. Some unwanted parasite in need of restraints. \""Shut up and let me get on with my awesome story won't you? No ofc I won't let you influence it - I tell it best as it is - I am in charge this experience not you!!\""As for fishing and hunting and doing bounties plus experiencing random world events - as well as crafting - they've actually done a good job. But like it always is with these things they do get repetitive after a while and starts to feel grindy. It doesn't help either that the world is so littered with animals you can almost aim the rifle randomly and still hit something nor that you'll catch a fish pretty much every time you throw your line in. It would have been better if wilderness encounters reaped higher rewards but were less frequent I feel - but it's nothing gamebreaking.All in all Red Dead Redemption 2 has all the ingredients to be the epic experience most reviewers make it out to be - but doesn't really come close in terms of execution. Gameplay is outdated and user-unfriendly - it lacks both polish and innovation - balance is a bit off here and there and the game fails miserably all across the line in terms of player interaction. The story and the missions are pretty much set in stone - and it refuses you to equip the chisel.Most of the time you're not really playing a game - merely watching events unfold the way the developers intended them to - practically sidelined and incapable of influencing anything at all.This game treats you more like a spectator than a participant.… Expand",True,0.22445217,0.007858276,0.049761772,0.08582769,0.12374964,0.030623792

Regarding the critics reviews of RDR2: is there something more sinister at play...?Pros:- When out and about in the open world\, the graphics are really nice\, the world feels very real and alive\, with weather changes\, wildlife\, nice scenery etc. The storms that come in look really beautiful.- There's clearly been an investment of time in covering details which make the towns look like real old west towns.- The option to kill/spare some side characters that you meet adds an element of Telltale to the game\, giving you the impression you're making your own story to some extent.Cons:- The control system really saps the fun out of the gameplay. It's convoluted\, confusing\, and very difficult to use\, especially during the times when you need to retrieve items fast from your inventory\, or switch guns. What were Rockstar thinking\, in making the control system this way??- The movements of Arthur Morgan are clunky and don't feel smooth. He's either sauntering at a snail's pace or running full out. No in between. The playable cut scenes restrict you in many ways\, but its' not always clear you're in one. It's frustrating. Gun fighting\, running from cover to cover is awkward and doesn't flow well. Fist fighting is mostly just mashing one button and requires very little skill. It's not fun. It's certainly no Batman Arkham.- It's too much hassle to commit any crimes. I defended myself against an O'Driscoll\, beat him up\, then the law was called on me. It wasn't clear what the sheriff wanted me to do? It seemed like he was telling me to 'go on\, git' (as in get out of here) but when I tried to run he started shooting. I then had to fight off a neverending spawn of deputies and run in my clunky run/swim style for about 15 minutes. The bounty system means its much. much more convenient to just pay off your bounties than continue to be an outlaw\, as your crimes never go away.- The graphics of close up faces aren't anything special for PS4. Detroit Become Human set the bar on graphics and RDR2 is nowhere even close.- There are just too many tasks/chores to remember! Brush your horse\, feed your horse\, shave your face\, clean your guns\, earn money for the camp\, hunt food for the camp\, wear the right warm/light clothing\, take this tonic\, eat this food\, and so on and so on. The tasks/chores actually do feel like chores\, and I want to play a video game\, not do chores.My advice would be if you are a RDR fan and want to give it a shot (no pun intended) then wait until the price goes down\, and maybe during that time the game will be patched a bit.Hopefully Rockstar will read some fan reviews and take note for their next endeavour\, as if RDR3 continues along this path\, I won't be buying it.… Expand",True,0.10913446,0.004310608,0.017766917,0.031256735,0.07385241,0.012906751

The items are good for a time\, but not unique enough to pay actual money for) on the middle version\, my score is remaining at a 6. Every 6-8 review on here hits the nail on the head. The game feels more like a movie and never gets truly fun. I'm halfway through chapter 4\, ignoring everything in the open world trying to force my way through missions on hopes that it gets better.The story isn't really all that good either\, aside from character originality and voice acting\, the gang gets into trouble in a new area and is forced to move. Rinse and repeat.The controls still feel awkward after getting used to them. The inventory is miserable. I never know what gun it's going to pull when I hit L1. What weapons I choose don't seem to matter as the game frequently unequips everything except my pistols when I get off my horse. And you can't drop or sell weapons you don't use or want anymore. You're stuck with them\, and it will annoy you to the point where you are looking for methods to get rid of them\, including letting an alligator bite your arm so you drop the equipped weapon.The only outside activity is hunting. And if it was more like the bear hunting quest in the beginning of the game\, it could actually be pretty fun. But it's not. Tracking system won't help you track anything you haven't seen first.

The animations are incredibly detailed. Visually judged alone it would be a great game sadly\, it is just a OK game\, it suffers from bad controls\, nagging issues - the controls are very unintuitive. To me things just seem randomly assigned as they went. This is hardly the biggest issue\, but a couple of examples are: on a PS4 controller - buying saddles is X with no confirmation or delay. Drilling down into the saddle menu is also X. Click X too many times and bam saddle bought\, money gone - you will buy one by accident - the only question is how long ago did you save and can you afford the mistake.  Yet buying stuff from the store is Square and it must be held for a second or two\, a timer thingy happens before it is done\, giving you a chance to release and cancel. Often pre-viewing an item at the store is X\, like spurs - so think you’re going to preview a saddle? nope. There is no buy back or undo option anywhere - selling or buying. Example #2 - Triangle is used to a) mount your horse b) loot dead bodies and c) sit by a fire. 90% of the bodies in the world you loot are going to be shot by a fire. Once looted you no longer can hit triangle to loot again... so you'd think priority of this conflict would go to looting\, take it out of the equation - then all that’s left for triangle is are you at a horse or a fire. This is not what they did instead you unintentionally will sit by a fire over and over instead of looting the body next to the fire - this includes the long assed sitting down animation and then the long assed standing up animation before you accidentally\, yet inevitably\, sit again.The game is so detailed... and soo “#realism brah”. To its detriment... you can't just have a health\, stamina and dead eye meter\, no you have to have \""cores\"" that drain and fill differently and make little sense - and there are 400 foods\, cigarettes\, and booze that all do slightly the same thing yet different. You can't sleep to a specified time\, no early rising for you – Morning\, noon\, evening or night but not 4 or 6 am. Crafting is horribly slow and boring yet pretty core to the game mechanics and so needed – cool bullets/arrows no one will ever use because its one at a freaking time! There are just SO many small frustrating bits that take away from the overall enjoyment. Saving - the autosave will scumbag you sooner or later if you rely on it. If you are mid mission and want to save to maybe go back and try something different or try another approach – nope not allowed because reasons. I turned off autosave and fully rely on being uber diligent with manual saves and every time I see a thing to go check out\, go near people/towns\, hear “Hey mister” or “HELP” - I save - because my fault or not (more often not)\, something will go wrong. Be it bugs\, glitches or just B.S. If I hit R1 to take cover behind a rock in combat; for god knows what reason I often end up standing on top of the rock eating bullets. Bump - not ram or run down - but nudge a person while on your horse in town and 40 cops and a massive bounty for that evil deed. To add to that fun - NPC’s will constantly be in your way. Crowded market or street\, they will be mad at you for following them (regardless of your “good” reputation) as they slowly walk down the only narrow path. They will walk out into the street in front of your horse constantly. There is a Cinematic mode that in theory could be considered an auto-travel so you don't have to do it yourself (tapping X over and over and over) - if you go to the bathroom and come back you will be dead\, wanted or your horse will have died. There is no fast travel. From camp after a while but nothing BACK to camp. Stages and trains cost money and you still must get to one to travel to another. On foot Arthur moves just a tad slower than he should until he runs and then you run just a bit faster than the controls really work with. Hunting can be fun and yet it can be the most frustrating thing I've ever voluntarily done to myself. My list goes on and on. For every amazing moment there are 30 little crappy ones sucking the fun out of this game. Just so disappointed. If there was QA that play tested their feedback was ignored\, they were awful at their jobs or they hired children who \""want to work in video games\"" for pennies a day instead of QA professionals - standard for the gaming industry and it shows.

Despite the fact it didn’t grip or didn't thrill me as GTA did\, it certainly had a personality all of its own and western plains never looked so good. I could look past the clunkiness of the controls and the hassle of the fast travel system and enjoy what it offered – a sprawling western adventure – albeit a rather shallow one.Fast forward a decade and finally\, we’ve been given the sequel (prequel?) and my hopes for this game were that Rockstar would hopefully improve on the negatives of the first game to bring us another sprawling western but\, this time alive with a living breathing world full of adventure and action because – it’s a game\, right?10-12 hours in on chapter 3 and I have to admit that it’s been a grind to get this far. Of those 10-12 hours\, I would wager that only an hour of that has been actual action. The rest has been horse riding\, performing menial tasks\, walking around aimlessly (and slowly) and cut-scenes.Not only that but\, they have not addressed the two biggest issues from the first game. The controls and fast travel. As I said higher up\, I could overlook the issues in the first game because it was last gen and what they achieved irrespective of issues\, was marvellous. They don’t have that crutch this time and for the length of time this has been in development\, these issues which are central to the playability of the game should have been addressed.1)	The Controls – The controls are reminiscent of Resident Evil. A slow-burning horror game where they work by creating tension. They don’t work in a western where you need to move\, sometimes very quickly\, in reaction to events. They are cumbersome and unintuitive and as someone else has posted\, they make Arthur appear arthritic in his movements. The buttons you have to manipulate to perform the most mundane task is ridiculous and far too many times\, I have shot people in the face because the R2 button which is used for shooting from the hip is also used for performing actions.2)	Fast Travel – if I thought fast travel in the first game was a ballache to use\, the fact they have hidden it in RDR2 is a monumental mistake. Rockstar in trying to create a sense of immersion want gamers to ride their horse across the plains to get from A to B – every time. That’s fine if the ride is 5 or even 10 minutes\, but\, we’re talking upwards of an hour in some cases. This is a game remember. It’s for enjoyment. I do not want to simulate the life of a cowboy down the nth degree. I want to cut out the real-time inconsequentiality to get to the meat of the task. I don’t like travelling anywhere as it is\, so why the f**k would I want to travel in real-time in a game. It’s a colossal waste of time and is the main issue of boredom.3)	Cut-scenes – I get it; they drive the story or give background. However\, they start to jar when they are 15 minutes long and I don’t want to see a cut-scene every time I perform a menial action.4)	Stats – I mean come on; a sense of reality is one thing – total immersion is entirely another. Like in GTA SA\, I now have to look after myself by eating\, drinking\, wearing the right clothes and not pushing myself too hard. Not only that\, but I also have to take care of my horse! Cue more cut-scenes\, more time wasting and more banality. It didn’t work in GTA SA and it doesn’t work here. Again\, this is a game and I don’t want to have to have to worry about my characters well-being. It should be a given that he looks after himself.There are many more issues I could list but\, those four are primary for me. Reading between the lines of reviews and gamer comments\, some appear to be in clear denial and I think that is simply because it’s Rockstar and Red Dead Redemption 2. They are refusing to acknowledge its genuine shortcomings preferring instead to regale its beautiful environment. However\, many games have beautiful environments such as; The Witcher 3\, Horizon\, ACO etc\, and all these games incorporate stellar gameplay mechanics and do not burden the player with unnecessary faff that detracts from the adventure.Would ACO be a better game if you had to travel the length and breadth of Greece by horse and boat? Nope. In fact\, do people who are raving about RDR2 play any open world games without using fast travel? I doubt it and that in itself is a contradiction by those proclaiming RDR2’s realism as the defacto reason for its immersion. A game is an escape for fun but\, when that fun is duller than ditchwater\, then it’s no longer a game. RDR2 is less an action game and more a simulation of life as a cowboy but\, it’s not a particularly interesting one because too much needless nonsense bogs it down making it a chore to play.RDR2 is quite simply\, a glorious looking world saddled with a shallow and monotonous gaming experience made worse by mechanics that are a decade old.… Expand",True,0.0926474,0.0035476685,0.015757138,0.030595649,0.05543986,0.0113014765

I understand realism and why it is important in games like this (large\, cinematic games) but the depth here doesn't add anything to the game except excess hours spent by the player doing these chores instead of actually engaging in the game. 'Depth' is fast becoming a code word in the gaming world for 'needlessly tedious tasks' but is defended with the 'realism' mantle. Realism and realistic are not the same things - I want the game to give me a sense of a real world\, I do not want it to mimic my actual life. I play games to have fun\, not to cook herbs I found.The bounty system is just horrible. Anything bad you do results in a bounty being put on your head (which increases if you do more bad things) - you have no choice put to pay off the bounty. If you do not bounty hunters randomly spawn and will shoot you to death. They will shoot you to death because 1) The computer has a very good shot and 2) because the shooting mechanic is so badly implemented that you will really struggle to fend off more than 2 of them. There is also an issue that NPC's assault you with abandon but\, as soon as you defend yourself\, you have a bounty marked on you. This\, combined with the poor shooting system\, means you spend most of your time avoiding combat - it's so weird because I was expecting to be able to cause havoc\, instead I can't risk it because money is scarce and the bounty's so frequent. A stifling game mechanic.Flawed features. The hunting system works to a degree but has a number of issues. The rewards for hunting are pitiful and\, given the time it takes to hunt\, as well as the lack of space to store hunted animals\, it is pretty much a redundant feature.The poker game in-game is nothing short of a joke. Don't even bother playing it as you will lose money if you play more than\, say\, 20 hands against the AI.Travel. By far the biggest problem. It takes ages to navigate this map - not because it is so big - but because you pretty much have to travel with your horse the whole time. Oh\, and you cannot even follow set paths\, so you have to control the giddy bastard for the entire time.Shooting system. Poor\, very twitchy and inaccurate - not at all fun to use.Crafting. Requires hunting stuff. Hunting stuff is very time-consuming and\, by an large\, boring.Controls. They are awkward. It does not feel smooth nor intuitive. They aren't game breaking by any means but they could be a damn sight better.It is another game that equates quantity with quality\, a trend in the gaming world whereby if you have massive crafting menu's and the ability to brush your teeth manually you're somehow revolutionising the industry. Maybe I'm the only gamer who wants the games to be\, first and foremost\, fun? I suspect there will be patches changing certain aspects of the game and\, until they happen\, I'd avoid buying the game. I'm playing now and wondering why I continue to do so because\, after getting out of the snow section (the very first part of the story)\, everything has become a lot more tedious and dull. 10 out of 10 is honestly a joke score - that indicates perfection\, and this game comes nowhere near that.Bugs:  A random civilian started a fistfight with me and I was wanted for unarmed assault after I defended myself. The next time a man spontaneously attacked me\, I decided to keep blocking just to see what would happen. Another random civilian shot him in the back and I was then wanted for murder. I steered my truck of a character to the outskirts of town only to find myself under investigation AGAIN because another random civilian was mauled by a mountain lion or something.I stopped hunting after my legendary bear pelt disappeared from the back of my main horse. I stopped riding my main horse entirely after I got tired of the game unequipped my weapons every time I made contact with it. The game is incapable of remembering that I put weapons in holsters\, but it knows exactly when that horse is in need of grooming. Because you know what every video-game needs more of? Chores.But none of that matters because the graphics are nice.

It has the illusion of being an open world game\, but there are very limited things you can do.First off the bounty system is broken.  If you try to be an outlaw you will have a bounty placed on you.  From time to time magical bounty hunters who seem to have cell phones and the ability to teleport always find you.  Odds are they will kill you because the shooting mechanics in this game are very weak.  Thats par for the course with Rock Star games.  Robbing a train in single player outside of a mission is rather pointless.  Once you dispatch all the guards on the train who are immediately alerted to your activities\, the train comes to a screeching halt.  This happens without fail and more law men appear out of no where and they will continue to do so.  Sure you can try and rob a train\, but it will end up costing you so much more in the long run.Truthfully this game wants you to just play the story missions.  Hunting is a complete waste of time and you make so little money doing it\, that its not worth doing at all.  The game is at its best when you stick to the story.  The map size is not the biggest they have ever made.  Sure it takes forever to get anywhere and fast travel isn't really a thing.  Sure you can hop on a train or take a stage coach\, but the stage coach wont take you if you have a bounty.The game only holds an sense of realism onto the player.  The world and all the NPCs in it seem to be able to do whatever they like without consequence.  Stop a murder by killing someone and you will likely be reported for murder.  The game doesn't want you to be an outlaw although your character is and if you try to be one it will punish you.Honestly for all the hype this game is a huge disappointment and missed the mark.  It isn't even close to being as good a game as GTA V.  I commend them for trying\, but it is truly limited by the time period.  Whats really disappointing is they didn't really improve upon Red Dead Redemption.  I would dare say that game was better than this one.Also at the time of this writing there is no multiplayer.  Even when it comes out there won't be much to do.  This game will be forgotten in no time because it just isn't that fun.  They tried to put fun things in it\, but it isn't enough to make it enjoyable.  For instance you can put a mask on your character when committing crimes.  Despite this everyone knows who you are immediately\, no matter what.  Makes me wonder why this mechanic is even in the game.  Seems to me it was just a story mechanic.I would say either don't buy the game or wait for a sale.  Also play it with a pillow near by because its a snooze fest.

79974,RDR2,2018-10-31,5.0,"After reading and listening for all the praises and comments about game details and balls shrinking from \""professional\"" reviewers I got hyped and bought the game expecting it to GOTY material. I say that in a year where we had Dragon quest 11 and God of War released.After 20 hours in I feel I have to write because I have not been that disappointed in a game since Assassin's Creed Unity.How is it possible to make such a bad game based on fetch quest years after Witcher 3 ? Did the other developers learned nothing.The game is slow\, boring and punitive for all the bad reasons. It's slow because controls are awful\, the world is huge and empty and you spend your time going from A to B and dying for stupid reasons. It's boring because all the quests are the same\, you have narrative where Rockstar believe they can master dialogues as well as Tarantino (they manage ok) then you have a very bad gunfight where you cover/auto aim/shoot\, have a quick narrative and rince and repeat. The rest of your time you actually work. You cook\, you collect grass\, you hunt animals for hours\, you clean stuff\, you clean yourself\, you clean your horse\, you clean your guns etc. It's a miracle we don't have to brush teeth and wipe ass.This\, and all the restrictions. You shall not have fun in this world. After a few hours\, after I gave all my money to my camp (which I am the only one doing\, others in the band seem to chew bubble gum all day long)\, I decided to be bad for once\, for fun and giggles.I got a 300 bucks bounty on my head I could not pay off. I was hounded by wizards and Jedi masters who always know exactly where I am at 4am in the morning when I have been in the forest alone for 2 days. They killed the horse I had bought (FUN) I kept losing all my hunting catches (FUN!!) I even lost legendary pelts (R u not entertained??).I found a secret place in town where there is illegal activity. I thought it would be easy money. You go there\, have a gunfight\, get spotted by law\, shoot them\, and get punished by a bounty higher than the money in the stash. It's great\, it's realistic. Of course not realistic to the point you can jump by the window or open the other door there\, no\, there s only one way in and out because it's FUN.I tried everything\, even going ninja like in there and kill everyone with throwing knives before a single shot (took me ages to pull this out) . The sheriff\, a jedi medium seer from the future with the hearing of daredevil still knows the law has been silently broken and intervene. It's all great\, it's so FUN.WHY?Why do I get punished ?I already work all day long. I don't play to work more and get punished. I just want to have fun\, like people in Westworld\, not feel what it was to do chores all day long on the Far West and be punished every time I don't play the way the devs want me to play.They have made a gorgeous\, beautiful world full of details and forgot how to make a fun game along the way. They have reached Ubisoft level. I can't believe this t... was made by the people who made Vice City\, one of the best game I ever played.I have to go.

Red Dead Redemption 2 has a LOT of serious problems. Realistic it is at times\, sprinkled liberally with jarring\, frustrating\, unrealistic\, inappropriate gamey mechanics.If you shoot up a gang's hideout in the woods and kill them all\, then go into the hideout and take something from a drawer\, you will be marked as a thief and the law will\, in less than a minute\, ride up and come after you --- even though you were in the hideout without witnesses when you took something from the drawer\, even though you're in the middle of the woods far from town. The law show up out of nowhere like magic. On top of all this\, the law doesn't seem to care that you shot a bunch of people and that there are bodies everywhere\, only that you stole a bottle of liquor.The game has other serious issues that also make it too 'gamey' and not realistic enough. In mission 1\, you cannot open a certain locked trunk you must open to complete the mission\, and the guy you're with will just freeze in place until ... you eat something. That's right. The one has got nothing to do with the other\, but you have to eat at least a cracker or that trunk will never open and your comrade will never take another step. The same thing happened in a mission much later when a guy took me bear hunting. All of a sudden he just stopped on his horse. Wouldn't move. Frozen. No matter what I did. Five minutes\, ten minutes\, 15 minutes passed. Still frozen. I never found the answer to that one. But I assume the game wanted me to engage in some random action utterly unrelated to what we were doing to trigger the game to move forward.In mission 2 if you stray too far from the enemy camp the mission ends in failure. Therefore\, if you shoot a fleeing bad guy off his horse\, then go to collect stuff off the body (as you are required to do for the mission) the mission will end in \""failure\"" if the body fell too far from the main camp. How's that for \""open world\""? In mission 3\, as you chase a man on his horse to lasso him\, you have to cross a stream to get behind him. But if you cross that stream too soon\, by which I mean before the game arbitrarily wants you to\, that mission also ends in \""failure\"".  How's THAT for open world??? When your fellow gang member is held as a human shield by a train conductor on the roof of a train\, you want to shoot the train conductor\, right? But if try\, you won't hit him\, and you won't accidentally hit your fellow gang member either. Even though they are\, at that moment\, closer than any other target you've had in the game so far. All of your bullets magically become blanks ... because the game wants you to go up to him and hit him with your fists. All of these artificial\, unnecessary\, extremely frustrating and anti-immersive moments broke the game's momentum and pushed me out of the fictional universe.When shooting\, if you don't want to use a reticle (and I don't) you can turn off the reticle in the options menu. You can still hit targets just fine because there is a command that lines the barrel right up with your sightline -- except ..... not when you're using a bow. Even though in real life you line the arrow right up with your line of sight while aiming\, this is not permitted in the game. Even though it's permitted with guns. So it is IMPOSSIBLE to hit a deer or other animal with an arrow unless you go into options and turn the reticle back on. So it's back and forth as I play because I do NOT want a reticle\, but have to use one when using a bow. Why in the world the game doesn't let you line your bow up with your line of sight is beyond me. It makes zero sense. These are the reasons I say the game is marred by bizarre limitations that render it not truly open world (in the way\, for example\, Skyrim is truly open world. In Skyrim you can go anywhere at any time\, even mid-mission if you want to\, you can take off and go hunting or fishing and just head for the other side of the continent. Not in Read Dead Redemption 2. You have to do arbitrary things - eat a cracker - before you can complete missions and you have to stay within very narrowly defined areas during missions.Side note. The dialog in the game is also laced with expressions that did not exist until my lifetime\, some not even until I was an adult. It is strange to watch as people in 1899 use lingo that did not even exist yet when I was in elementary school. The team really dropped the ball on this. They should have had an older person reviewing the script. It is jarring in places and really puts me out of the game here and there.

Anything bad you do results in a bounty being put on your head (which increases if you do more bad things) - you have no choice put to pay off the bounty.  If you do not bounty hunters randomly spawn and will shoot you to death.  They will shoot you to death because 1) The computer has a very good shot and 2) because the shooting mechanic is so badly implemented that you will really struggle to fend off more than 2 of them.  There is also an issue that NPC's assault you with abandon but\, as soon as you defend yourself\, you have a bounty marked on you.  This\, combined with the poor shooting system\, means you spend most of your time avoiding combat - it's so weird because I was expecting to be able to cause havoc\, instead I can't risk it because money is scarce and the bounty's so frequent.  A stifling game mechanic.The realism and depth.  The game is realistic\, so realistic that it is boring because it is so like real life.  You have to cook\, you have to dress accordingly\, you have to brush your horse\, the list  goes on and on and on.  I'm surprised they didn't make you take your turn to wash the dishes in camp in order to keep harmony.  I understand realism and why it is important in games like this (large\, cinematic games) but the depth here doesn't add anything to the game except excess hours spent by the player doing these chores instead of actually engaging in the game.  'Depth' is fast becoming a code word in the gaming world for 'needlessly tedious tasks' but is defended with the 'realism' mantle.  Realism and realistic are not the same things -  I want the game to give me a sense of a real world\, I do not want it to mimic my actual life.  I play games to have fun\, not to cook herbs I found.Flawed features.  The hunting system works to a degree but has a number of issues.  The rewards for hunting are pitiful and\, given the time it takes to hunt\, as well as the lack of space to store hunted animals\, it is pretty much a redundant feature.The poker game in-game is nothing short of a joke.  Don't even bother playing it as you will lose money if you play more than\, say\, 20 hands against the AI.Travel.  By far the biggest problem.  It takes ages to navigate this map - not because it is so big - but because you pretty much have to travel with your horse the whole time.  Oh\, and you cannot even follow set paths\, so you have to control the giddy bastard for the entire time.Shooting system.  Poor\, very twitchy and inaccurate - not at all fun to use.Crafting.  Requires hunting stuff.  Hunting stuff is very time-consuming and\, by an large\, boring.Controls.  They are awkward.  It does not feel smooth nor intuitive.

Here's an example of how I spent my last 90 minutes of play time: The only available story mission was deep south so it was a good 10 minutes horse ride to a new area.  The missions was ok and straightforward\, involving raiding some bounty hunters and saving a friend.  Afterwards I opt to stay and look for look a little longer.  Well after maybe 30 seconds a huge posse of lawmen show up \""Investigating.\""  So much for looting\, because that could have been fun getting some actual reward for the mission.  Now I'm running for my life.  I lose the law but I'm even further south away from my base camp and Arthur is \""exhausted.\""  Don't know why because I sleep every night as soon as it gets dark and eat food often.  I try to camp and can't because there is \""Activity\"".. in the whole territory I guess because I'm running further away from this town to try and camp.  I'm Wanted in this area so I try to sneak into a town to hire a Stagecoach to take me into a town closer to my gang's camp.  The driver won't take me because I'm wanted.  The ride on horse looks like 15 minutes at this point and I just want to get to a safe area so I can log out and quit playing for the night.  I avoid more lawmen to get to the nearest train station and hire my first train ride to take me somewhere.  I get to my destination and my horse is out of range. But\, hey!  I'm an outlaw... I can just steal a ride right?  Arthur still hasn't slept so he can barely run so I try and hold up a carriage passing by.  Every single driver either pulls a gun on me or takes off.  Not only that but there is a witness to this crime\, and lawmen instantly head towards my area and remember\, I can barely run.  I love how every back country road is packed with traffic so that you can't rob a single person with a chase ensuing...  at night.  It's like the game was forcing me into a corner\, challenging me to not like it.At that point I spent 10 minutes actually having fun and 80 minutes just traveling or avoiding the law.Aside from that\, every time I'm in camp everyone yells at me for not chipping in to the pot when I donated an entire deer and a couple gold watches just 2 days earlier.   I feel all of these people would starve and die without me doing all of the work for them.  LOL  And then I get 10% of loot taken on missions.  Ok.Other major quips:  The icons on the radar and map are so tiny I have to hover over each one to tell what it is.  You can tell devs play-tested this on monitors a couple inches from their faces instead of on a flat screen 10 feet away.The main camp is horribly designed where\, at first\, nearly every tent looks the same and you wander about hovering over things to figure out where you are.  And you better be an inch away from whatever object  you are interacting with and no further.  And there's no running in base camp because outlaws don't run.  I thought the gang would have maybe 5-6 bad hombres in it but there's entire families with women and children.  Plus a science nerd and some English geek\, of course.I've lost loot like pelts\, including my first legendary bear pelt because I left it on the back of my horse.My horse teleports to weird places around the map and when I whistle\, he returns very slowly and always stops behind a bush.I get off of a horse and my weapon load out changes and sometimes I start missions with only my pistol and lasso.Button layouts are random and confusing so there's no wonder that there are hints in the screen corner because I would honestly forget.  At one point you need to hold down 3 buttons and a joystick to select items from your inventory.  And 10 years later I wish Rockstar would fix the pressing L3 stick causes you to crouch.  Annoying.Finally Arthur is no where near a likeable character like John was.  John has the cool gravely voice but Arthur honestly sounds like a dumb hillbilly at times.  Many of the main characters have very annoying voices now that I think about it.  Not a threatening group at all.Man it sucks to say all of this\, because the original RDR is my favorite game of all time\, but it seems my rating is clinging to the Yellow category just due to the graphics and my love of this franchise.  I wouldn't fault anyone for rating it less.… Expand",True,0.3281604,0.023076924,0.052035484,0.100019015,0.22889622,0.059796512

Don't get me wrong RDR2 is a beautiful immerse game but as I got older I realized that I needed more content and less tedious mundane tasks that I do from 9-5. It needed to be more than just ride one direction and back to complete a mission.So\, let's get into the review part.Story:Last time around I felt more invested in the story. I feel like with every Rockstar game you really care and feel for the characters even though the characters are protagonists with the life of crime. Arthur isn't really a cool character he's just there and whoever you put in his place would be fine. I don't get a sense of his personality to the world. Honestly\, if this was GTA 3 and the character didn't talk I would've felt the same way. With all the other characters\, every time you do a mission you're like who theis this guy that's giving me this mission\, oh okay some random member of the gang. Great... You're not hooked on being that guy or another.Mission gameplay:The world is big like really big... like I ride for 15 mins kill someone then realize... I have to ride back now... 30 mins spent on just riding. Shooting is clunky and majority of the time is spent using Dead Eye to kill people. The first person then becomes a bit unplayable. The realistic part is there\, you definitely can't just walk towards enemies and kill everyone without hiding. On PC\, I think the shooting would've been a bit better\, but we shall see when it's released.Overall experience:The game is filled with stuff to do but it feels empty... idk maybe I'm just outgrowing single player campaign games.

The other huge issue that needs patched is the character models looks like A$$\, like early ps4 games A$$. The HDR doesn't work and screenshots looks hideous. There isn't a photo mode? I know some don't care\, but I love showing off the games I play and having good pictures helps a lot. What I do like is the care and detail to the world\, the shop books are incredibly done\, corpses rot\, people remember you when you save them\, the random occurrences are Skyrim good!

Rockstar has tried to nail down the realism of RDR2 to its core but instead of enhancing the gaming experience\, to me it feels like there is more control over the player and what he can do then actual freedom within the game.One thing that is really bothersome is when Arthur tries to do anything in camp.  He moves at a slow pace and there is no work around to have Arthur move faster within camp.  Horses cannot be ridden to your bed and skinned animals cannot be dropped off at the butcher.  Trying to successfully accomplish a task within camp can sometimes feel like you're fighting the controls when you are trying to achieve a button prompt.  I think it has something to do with the camera and the way Arthur steps around\, he could sometimes hum over certain prompts within camp just because he isn't positioned right or directly over the object.The button prompts have drastically changed from Red Dead 1 to 2.  Now you can essentially \""engage\"" someone by holding L2 and focusing in on them.  This has caused me more problems with the NPC's then good ones... I don't know why but everytime I try to talk to someone or focus in on them\, I get into more fights then friendly banter.  I'm also not really into holding the square button when trying to pick up a body or animal pelts and then you use the Triangle button to loot bodies and mount your horse.  Its confusing what i'm trying to say and can really halt the progress of normal mundane tasks because the player is confused trying to figure out how to achieve his goal.  Picking up someone else's gun is the same concept too.  You have to Press R1 to scroll over the option menus to choose the right prompt and then press L1 to switch a weapon you wanted to pick up.  Its just a mess really and game play wise extremely confusing.The menu is cluttered\, making it confusing for the user making it a hard time understanding what exactly could be sold at a market or used for practicality.  There isn't a sorting option available that organizes your pack for you\, which I feel like they sorely needed to implement or give the option to manually sort items for ourselves so we can clearly define exactly what we need and what we don't need.One last thing.. The hunting is really bad.  Really really bad.  Its VERY hard to track and find an animal let alone kill it properly to get the perfect skin.  it takes more time out the game when trying to hunt and it does it in way that doesn't feel satisfying.  Hunting gameplay needs a huge look at and needs to be made in a way thats more friendly and rewarding to do.There are things that bother me about RDR2\, its more about the controls then anything but the story and quests are engaging.  Its a rockstar game in an open world scenario.  You're going to be fetching things\, you're going to be an errand boy but thats how its always been.

There are no spoilers since I'm not that far into the game\, everything I state will not ruin anything.  I am Brutallyhonestgamer on YT\, so those that know my vids know I am not paid or here to sugar coat things but give my honest opinion.I've never played the first game\, so this is my first experience\, here are my first impressions of the game.What I want to focus on are some of the annoyances of the game\, so maybe it will help people avoid\, or find a better way for certain situations.  We all know the game is very pretty\, the sounds and music are all great\, so there's no point on focusing on that. The game play overall is good  with some annoyances that I will detail below. So let's get started.To big for its britches. That's probably the biggest thing so far\, and what I mean by this is that I'm 12 hours into the game and I still kinda feel like I'm playing a tutorial.  I've just started to expand outside of Valentine\, and just recently after 12 hours\, unlocked the guy that I can sell stolen goods to. This is kind of unacceptable\, as it's already hard enough to come by money\, and it's very easy to get a bounty on you.  Also\, 12 hours in and I don't know anything more about the story\, I know something happened in Blackwater\, but I don't know what\, I don't know the significance of it\, I don't know why I should care about any of the characters.  I keep doing missions for people but don't seem to be expanding on anything.  I assume this will change\, but still\, this far into a game\, I was hoping for a little bit of light shed on the situation.  The dialogue and all that is great\, don't get me wrong\, I just feel the game is to slow.The saving is ****  For those that never played the first game\, you have to go into the options and then to story to save a game.  Why isn't there a save/load right at the menu?? I lost my favorite horse and **** before I was told you can actually manually save.  If you don't manually save before a random encounter and you screw it up\, it's over\, you don't get a second chance\, which brings me to bull**** point #2.  The first gun fight I was in\, quick draw\, the tutorial instructions started in the top left corner of the screen\, then moved to the bottom\, so I missed the 2nd set of instructions\, was killed\, and then could not try it again.  ****  Also a random stage coach came out of nowhere\, killed my horse and me\, and bull****\, could not restore a point before that\, so now the horse is lost.Where's my hat?  The hat is ****  You constantly lose your hat\, it's annoying as hell so I've basically given up on it.Bounty.  Bounty is ****  I had a $200 Valentine bounty and nobody seemed to care while in town.  I was actually able to go into the sheriffs office\, have them pay me for doing bounty missions.  The bounty seems to only matter when you get bounty hunters that are impossible to kill coming after you.  When they kill you\, the bounty isn't collected and it goes away\, you still have it until you pay it off.   Secondly the whole crime system seems broken.  You can do what you want as long as nobody is around\, ok that's fine\, but if someone shows up later and you are still in the vicinity\, you are assumed the criminal.  I found this to be the case whether the body was hidden or not\, also hiding from the law is impossible\, so don't try it\, they will find you\, no matter how well hidden in bushes or whatever\, you have to outrun them.Whores please\, no? So 12 hours in and you can't sleep with whores\, when the option comes up\, both decisions are NO\,  I assume this will change once i get to a certain point in the game\, but\, 12 hours in and still haven't unlocked all the functions of the game\, are you kidding me?Borrowing vs stealing.  This is mega ****  So there's an early mission where you borrow a horse.  Ok fine\, you can return it and you get honor points for it\, but if you need a horse for something else\, then your a horse thief and you get bounty. What the hell.  There's no way to tell.Fist Fighting.  You get one tutorial and no reminders.  So when you get used to left trigger to aim and right trigger to attack\, by the time i got to my next fight I forgot the game mechanics change to square/circle\, why couldn't LT be block and RT be punch? You could have triangle to pull gun\, no reason to changeLasso hassle.

You don’t have to sacrifice fun to make it more immersive\, you can have both. “Well you make a better game then\, cried the fanboy” I will give an example on how to improve the game\, hope that is enough?In camp you do choirs to boost the morale for your partners in crime\, chopping wood for example. I don’t mind doing it\, if you actually make it rewarding instead of feeling like a proper choir\, we all have enough of those irl.Chopping wood: You walk up press triangle and watch Arthur do a 10 sec animation of him swinging the axe\, then you get to press R2 to see him do it again for 10 sec\, R2 and repeat.Improvement: A minigame where you have to angle the axe correctly with the analog stick to actually hit the wood while timing the swing with R2.It’s the same scenario with other tasks that you are required to do; Brushing your horse\, skinning a animal\, cooking\, weapon maintenance etc. Implement minigames that is rewarding and challenging and these realistic features becomes entertaining.My next rant\, the interface – Long story short\, its overly complicated.You press L1 to get a equipment-wheel where you browse different weapons\, press R1 to change to a different wheel with consumables. Browse between the different items with R2 and lift L1 to equip/consume. It’s complicated\, you missclick way too easily and its hard to get a overview on your inventory\, esp in a fire fight.In order to open the world map you have to press Options\, wait for 1½ sec for the menu to load and then press X. Why not do like every other game where you press touchscreen and from there you can browse your inventory\, journal etc? Now these functions are spread out in different menus without any apperant logic behind.Shopping is also too complicated. I want to buy a hat and a jacket\, here how it goes:Walk into storeL2 to greet shopkeeperX to see catalogYou get a realistic catalog with a “root-menu”Select ClothingSubmenu: Select hatsYou get to browse differnet pages in the catalog with drawn pictures of hats and get to select the one you like\, press X to view on character.All of a sudden you have a list of all the hats available and can skip through them all to try before you buy.From here you actually have to go back to the rootmenu in the realistic catalog and start over and do the whole process all over again. Why not give us an option to press Circle in the hat-menu\, select jacket and browse them quick and easy?A lot of people complain about Arthur being slow and its true\, he is. But I don’t think that is such a problem. It gives the game a different feeling that I can appreciate. If it was consistent.. It is not. You can run at a certain phase all over the world\, but when you spend time in camp Rockstar decided to cap it by half. I get it\, they want the player to really notice the details they invested in the environment here in camp. The problem is\, it doesn’t work that way. Don’t force me to stop and appreciate as I will only get annoyed and see even less.I could continue ranting about the game mechanics\, strange UI and wierd priorities; realism vs fun\, that you can’t summon your horse\, how bleak the gun fights are\, awkward controls but I think I have made my point. Its a flawed game with a beautiful facade and a good story. Almost like they did a remake with improved graphics but forgot to hire people to upgrade the game mechanics to the smooth standard we are used to in games in 2018.I really hope that Rockstar can remove the horse blinders\, listen to the legit critique some people try to raise and patch the game to the masterpiece it could have been.. But whom am I fooling?Reading the professional reviewers whom should be objective when judging a game but won’t even mention to bring up the strange controls and outdated game mechanics\, something that would be a major drawback for a total score on any other game out there. R*logo equals quality\, through and through. Otherwise you don’t get it\, or the game isn’t for you. The end.But the game is for me - I love open world games in general\, I loved RDR1 in particular and have been hyped for a sequel for as long as the rest of you.. It’s just that I cant praise a game this flawed. Please do better.… Expand",True,0.07371122,0.0049209595,0.019374741,0.022770792,0.070942834,0.013321015

They would give you a list: the world would feel too big after a while\, not in a good way\, bike riding would get tedious\, the game would rely on shooting mechanics and good cutscenes\, which aren't really strong enough to hold up the entire experience\, and they might even beg the question\, why focus on open world traveling\, then\, if it's so boring? Oh\, and an open world without civilized flourishes would also be strictly a downgrade\, even if the resolution went up\, because it'd just be samey forests and less interesting small towns\, ala San Andreas\, nothing impressive there outside Mt. Chilead (which nobody would WANT to ride a bycycle to\, btw). As far as I can tell: every last critique applies to both RDR games. Rockstar still can't transcend it. Their games rely on you being gobsmacked by how great and real the world feels\, and this ages poorly over years (GTA 3 and San Andreas are now unplayable\, I think\,) and in real time (you get bored by its impressive-but-samey landscape after a few hours.)13 years later\, despite massive efforts\, graphical improvements over GTA V\, and a solid effort to make the open world more lootable\, interactive (like Bethesda\, Ubisoft\,)  Rockstar hasn't really averted the pitfalls anybody could have told you in 2005. And they haven't realized the self-serious cutscenes can't hold up the gameplay\, because GTA satire is actually essential..these people need to be cartoons\, or \""the story is ludicrous\,\"" to quote Maude Lebowski.

No the story does not get lost in the open world\, if anything it's the opposite. The open world is flat and boring that the only interesting thing to do in it is the main story.The graphics are 10/10 no doubt\, as is the music\, voice acting and overall sound design\, the story and writing are also 10/10 no complaints here at all. But that is where the positives end.On to the gameplay and this were the game stumbles big time IMO\, where do i even start.The controls\, my god this game has what might be the worst control scheme I think i have ever played in a game period. It is the most convoluted\, self contradicting button mashing s%@t fest that has ever graced a gamepad. This also extends to the in game menus which are a chore to sort through. The controls and context sensitive menus has caused me no end of frustration\, things like pulling out my weapon to aim or shoot is the same buttons for talking to people\, who thought this was a good idea now I have a bounty on me and i am running from the law\, wait let me just get out my shotgun I selected 2 minutes ago\, oh wait Arthur has my bolt action equipped for some random reason instead which leads to a death. And this kind of crap is just a tip of the Ice berg\, the controls are simply counter intuitive to game raging degree. Melee fighting is garbage\, it is just rock paper scissors with no depth to it at all\, one or two button mashing until you win the fight or loose the fight.Some please tell the game to stop taking control away from me at every turn\, get to camp\, walk at a snails pace\, go inside a house walk at a snails pace etc i want to run dam it. getting chased by wolves and the camera gets taken over by the game to focus on the wolves behind me even though i am well ahead of the situation and i want shoot them but i cant\, i am just doing donuts on my horse instead because the game wont let me take control of the frigging camera.The game tries to pass itself off as a super realistic almost cowboy simulator where you have to eat drink\, and sleep etc\, but at every turn it contradicts itself with super unrealistic scenarios. on multiple occasions I have shootout in area only to get chased out for whatever reason so i mark the spot to come back so that i can loot the bodies i left\, it's only been a couple of minutes and i have not ridden very far and when i get back the bodies have mysteriously vanished in to thin air. Spawning lawmen\, this makes sense in a modern setting with cars\, radios and helicopters but not in the wild west\, when getting chased by the police handfuls will randomly spawn in front of you even though the nearest county is 3 hours ride away via horseback.  I can only carry 4 weapons on me yet I can have a library full of books and a shop full of alcohol\, tonics and herbs in my tiny little satchel\, yeah ok then.On to the witness system\, Jesus this one of the most irritating systems In the game for me along with the controls. So I get ambushed and have to defend myself\, yet there is a witness nearby that sees the shootout yet i am the one that gets into trouble for it even though i did not start the fight. WANTED! $10 bounty. I accidentally bump into someone they punch my lights out so i punch them back\, witness sees it\, WANTED! $20 bounty. I accidentally run some one over on my horse because they walked right out in front of me\, WANTED again $50 bounty and it just keeps going. Not to mention you spend 5 minutes hunting down a witness to stop him\, another witness is near by sees you threaten him or whatever then you chase him down and so on it goes WANTED! do you see a pattern emerging here it's unrealistic and not fun in the least.And this my main issue with this game\, the story missions are great\, they suck you in to this grand sweeping story that is written like poetry\, but the fact is outside of that\, it just isn't fun\, and at the end of the day\, this why I want to play a video game\, to have fun which this game is not. Don\,t get me wrong I have had some enjoyable moments actually playing the game they are just so few and far between and my experience has been more frustrating than enjoyable.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a gorgeous looking cinematic disguised as a video game. It seems like the folks at Rockstar put a lot of time into trying to make this game movie-like instead of focusing on gameplay. I'll focus on what I think the main points of the game are here:STORY:We all loved playing former gang member turned bounty hunter\, John Marston\, in the first game. That alone helped all of us want to play this prequel. This game focuses on an entirely new character named Arthur Morgan within the Van der Linde gang. The cinematic quality of the story is pleasing and there is more character development this time around. However\, I never really found a connection with Arthur like I did with John. John's story was straightforward with a hint of mystery which made it very thrilling to play. Arthur's story seems quite the opposite. Not as thrilling a character to play as.DESIGNI must say\, one of the overwhelming positives of this game has to be the breathtaking graphics. It is a stunning upgrade over the previous entry. I've been playing it on my 75Inch HDR 4K TV on my PS4 Pro and I have to say it is nothing short of beautiful. Riding through the country side watching day turn into night\, lifelike animals and sounds were all stunning to behold. Cutscenes play out like a Quentin Tarantino movie. Nothing bad to say hereGAMEPLAYHere is where my main issue lies. The gameplay of RDR2 is not bad but not great either. You'll spend most of your time doing mundane tasks like shaving\, sleeping\, eating\, grooming your horse\, etc... While these aspects of the game add a realistic quality to the gameplay\, they can be quite tedious and ultimately boring. They seem to slow down the gameplay and fun factor. Also\, the gameplay mechanics could be better. Aiming is a real pain and horses aren't very fast. The amount of time it takes to get from one place to another on horseback is ridiculous. It's almost as if the developers wanted people to be forced to enjoy the scenic route from one objective to another. Even though you are able to be a murderous and thieving outlaw\, it seems like the game punishes that behavior. You'll be hunted by bounty hunters and not able to step foot in town without being swarmed by lawmen. Not to mention the only way to remove your notoriety is to pay off your bounty which is hard considering money isn't easy to come by.SUMMARYRDR2 is a good game with some noticeable flaws.

76312,RDR2,2020-11-01,9.0,"Absolute masterpiece. Read Dead Redemption II is one of the best games I've ever played in my life\, and there have been a few. Unfortunately\, I didn't play Red Dead Redemption I and that's why I didn't know much about the story of Dutch and the others acting from first game\, but that didn't stop me from falling in love with all the characters immediately. I'm not the biggest lover of westerns\, whether movies or games. Anyway\, this game completely changed my mind about it. The atmosphere is great\, the soundtrack is guilty\, and not to mention dubbing. It's one of the few games where I really wanted to explore every single piece of the map. All the side quests are great and the main storyline is even better. Anyway\, I praised the game now. Now\, to come to the disadvantages\, which are not so much\, but they will definitely ruin your gaming experience. I don't really understand why they gave them a reputation. The only thing I noticed were other dialogues\, such as when Arthur dies and you had a good reputation\, so others will remember you in a good way and vice versa. And that brings me to the second minus. Why do you even give functions there\, such as robbing passers-by or whole shops. I just never understood Tp. You are a bandit\, literally your livelihood or you want to \""work\"" depends on robbing people. But almost by no means can you rob people or a business without anyone noticing. And if someone notices you\, your reputation will drop\, which you don't want because you want to finish it on the so-called \""good\"" Arthur. He would have welcomed the fact that if they had put their reputation away completely and if others would remember you in a good or bad way\, the point determined how many side missions or important decisions you had made. I would have a few minuses that have happened to me only a few times\, but they are just annoying. E.g. When I was doing the main storyline\, I played a great soundtrack there and I rode a horse. I accidentally bumped into and fell. And when I started riding again\, the music stopped and played even though I was only halfway through the road. Sure\, it's mostly my fault that I can't ride\, but the game just has to reckon with. And what bothers me more is when you ride a horse in Saint Denis and you run into OMIL someone\, so it has no problem pulling a gun at you and starting to shoot. But no one solves it. If you only dare to punch him after he started firing\, all the cops around you will run up to you and arrest you. This is downright a searing mechanism. Well\, to sum it all up. Read Dead Redemption II is an absolutely excellent game that I recommend to everyone\, even those who do not like westerns\, because you will just fall in love with this. The story is great and it made me turn a blind eye to the smaller bugs and give Read Dead Redemption II nine and half out of ten.… Expand",True,,,,,,

I was going to give it a 7 for these reasons:BAD:—Really clunky\, awkward controls. In the balance between ‘cinematic’ and ‘precise’ movement\, the game is too far towards ‘cinematic’. They try to correct this during a gunfight by using the world’s most aggressive auto-aim adjustment\, meaning you only have to aim within ten or fifteen degrees of a target and your cursor will snap right on him. This makes the game a smidge too easy when you’re winning\, and frustrating when you’re losing. The most common reason I died was because I was mashing R1 trying to get behind something as cover and instead of doing that\, my character was gracefully and cinematically adjusting his weight\, a movement that lasts the length of a solar body’s rotation around the center of the universe.—The characters chatting as they rode their horses to the next objective. Look\, this is just a personal preference\, but I listen to sermons as I play games\, and having the characters constantly chat at me meant I couldn’t focus on the sermons. I would have preferred it if they had cut out making me ride my horse to the objective entirely\, and instead had made all the dialogue part of a single cutscene and showed a scene of us riding to the location.—As you’re following your party to the next quest\, even if you cut to Cinematic View to engage the auto-drive (which is not explained well in the game btw)\, you have to hold X so your horse will keep going.

Some may not like it due to the controls or long horse rides\, but I got used to the controls fairly quickly and although the horse rides are a bit annoying\, they aren’t too bad. I love the shooting mechanics in this game. The first fights and melee are simple\, but that didn’t bother me.Now we move onto missions\, another thing some people don’t like. I like the missions well enough. They mostly go like this: Start mission\, ride to point A\, get in big gun fight/confrontation\, escape and ride to point B. A bit repetitive now that I think about it\, but I didn’t notice when playing the game.Story\, yet another thing people who don’t like this game much... well... don’t like. I think that the story is amazing. I love it. People say it’s okay and the player doesn’t have much impact\, almost like it’s a movie instead of a game. I can see where people are coming from\, they have a bit of a point\, but I just love the story. It starts off a bit slow\, then picks up in the middle\, then at the end everything just crashes down.  I love every single character\, especially Arthur\, the main character. He goes through a change and at the end is a bit of a different person. I love the story to death\, and that’s my opinion.Music is also very good. The soundtrack for the game is great\, very good songs in there\, go listen to it.World is also great. Lots of interesting events. *very minor spoiler* For example\, you’re riding through the bayou when you see a blip on the map. You check it out and it’s some dude who’s been bitten by a gator. You take him to the doctor in the city and witness the amputation of his arm. Later in the game you can have another encounter with him. He meets you again by chance\, thanks you\, and tells you to buy one thing from the gun store and put it on his tab. This is one of many encounters in the game. The world is although just huge. There’s snowy mountains\, lush forests\, grassy plains\, and large deserts.Now there’s Online mode... Where do I start... the story is amazing\, the online is crap. Buggy mess\, nothing to do\, animal spawns are just terrible\, money is so scarce.

The only reason I would recommend playing Red Dead Redemption first is that it is a game of the previous generation and it is visually very far away from Red Dead Redemption II.Observing graphics\, I must say that I have seen better looking games for PS4 but I do not have any problem with that because there are other stuff in this game that are superb. The first one is the story\, which is very exciting and it kept me attached to it till the very end. And even after the end there is decent and not so short epilogue to go through.Side missions and side content is very good. It is very seldom that I am satisfied with side missions and side content in open world games but in this game it is well done. You can really lose yourself in the world and accidentally find something that will lead you to some side story. Those side quests were mostly very interesting and I managed to complete a lot of them even though I am not a guy who is crazy about hunting 100% completion.This game has some pretty realistic stuff in its gamplay. For instance\, you will have to be careful when climbing mountains because you can fall and hurt yourself very easily. The same is when riding a horse. And you will have to take care of your horse; to feed it\, clean it otherwise its behaviour might change and it won't respond to your commands. You will have to take care of yourself es well. You must eat and drink\, you are able to lose and gain weight. You have to take care about what you wear because your character can feel warm\, cold or hot. For the most of the time you will be a part of the gangster camp and you will have to take care of it as well; to be sure that there's food\, medicine and weapons and ammunition for your people. It is all really well done\, it is not complicated but I was able to spend hours and hours just living in this world without doing any concrete mission or progressing the main story.What is unbelievably good in this game is that developers had so small amount of copy-paste work done. To make an example\, when you aren't on a mission and you are just walking around and listening to what other people speak around\, you can really hear so many things\, even the whole stories.

From the Ambarino mountains to the Lemoyne marshes\, from Valentine to Saint Denis\, from the smallest elaboration of the environment to the catalog of weapons (identical to the real catalog of those years).The plot\, the word redemption in the title is not for nothing\, in the first half of the game\, the plot is extremely slow to develop\, but after Chapter 4\, the plot is transformed. First of all\, this is facilitated by the characters. Almost every member of the Van Der Linde gang is at least a memorable character\, especially the main character\, Arthur Morgan is one of the best characters in the history of the gaming industry.

Gorgeous vistas that have a variety of different climates really immerse you in this vision of the old west. The graphical fidelity extends to the character models and the horses too. The way snow is displaced as your character wades through it for instance. Yet\, perhaps this is also one of Red Dead 2's shortcomings.While the attention to detail and animations is top-notch. At times it can be painstakingly slow to do a simple action like looting a body. This may not seem like a big deal but it adds up over time. This extends to the lack of a fast travel system outside of the wagons or trains you can catch from major settlements. You're going to be doing a lot of riding on horseback. You get to take in the beautiful world that has been created. But there is a lot of downtime between missions.Combat and gunplay are satisfying and visceral. There is a variety of ways to approach a given situation. You can lasso horses and people (even dragging them if you choose).

I did dredge through this monotonous snooze-fest of beautiful scenery and was just left with the annoyance of time wasted with no payoff.The annoyance that hit me first in the game is that while it has amazing attention to details\, it's in all the wrong places. Like the horse testicles are modeled\, but no one bothered to have even a cursory glance at how horses behave. You really can't ride a horse off a cliff\, unless there's a lot of trust to begin with. Also\, you can't ride a horse into a tree\, even if you wanted. In RDR 2\, the horses will run into trees and off cliffs\, even if you have just stolen the horse. This is just stupid and immersion breaking. It's like the devs have never actually seen a live horse\, let alone interacted with one in any capacity.  Also\, the movement of there character movement is nicely physically modeled but they control like they are walking on stilts.The story was also just phoned in. The same story arc is told several times with minor variance.  The characters are mostly at least adequately written\, but the story does not reflect these characters in any way and forces and even requires them to behave in a very different manner than what the characters would reasonably do. The story also drags on and on with not a lot of story to tell. This is not up to Rockstar's usual standards.The gameplay is clunky\, not a deal breaker\, but nothing to write home about. The less said about the horses\, the better.The worst thing about the game is in its pacing. It does seem like a giant middle finger pointed at the player. Most of the time is spent going from from point A to point B. There's also an astounding amount of busy work that's neither challenging or fun. The absolute low-point for me was a house-building sequence\, where you just tapped a single button for several minutes\, what engaging gameplay. There are some high points in the game but they are few and far between. The mission lengths were also all over the place with no real indication\, whether the mission would be a shorter thing or 1 hour ride-to-several-places.  Not that the missions couldn't be partitioned in a way since most of the long missions are spent just going to somewhere\, slowly. The completely arbitrary mission lengths would not be so annoying\, if you could save in the missions and not having to play a boring riding sequence again if you want to go to sleep or something.All this being said\, RDR 2 has a good game in it\, but it's just buried under a huge pile of pretentious disregard for the medium. Then again\, the single player story might just be a lazy throw-in for a cash-grab multiplayer.… Expand",True,0.20265625,0.008430481,0.02821777,0.06984934,0.13697,0.029933142

The missions are horrible\, starting a mission takes too much time. You have to ride back and forth a long way on your horse and there is a cutscene for every little thing. Some of the cutscenes are useless. The missions isn't even worth completing since you just have to get on your horse after and ride again somewhere else to start a repetitive mission and boring cutscene. Every move you do results in a cutscene. The character has more cutscenes or need to make a movement to interact with an object. Like when sitting\, mounting your horse or walking inside a store. The movements could be better and  faster. Many missions were boring and not adding anything to the game. How is fishing\, taking wildlife photography or help some circus folks catching animals relevant to being an outlaw. There are not really any rewards for completing a mission. You earn money that you end up losing because Arthur dies. There ain't even anything good to spend money on in this game.

77107,RDR2,2020-02-27,10.0,"While it certainly has its issues\, Red Dead Redemption 2 is\, quite simply put\, one of the most astounding games I've ever played. Speaking as someone who'd never played a Rockstar game before (yes\, really)\, I thought it impossible for them to live up to their reputation as a developer. I've rarely been so happy to be proven wrong.Let's get the negatives out of the way first\, as there's not many of them and they're completely\, utterly\, stupidly outweighed by the game's positives. The controls and shooting mechanics are a bit clunky\, but are nowhere near poor enough to damage the experience\, and aren't really any worse than other critically acclaimed games like The Witcher 3 and Shadow of the Colossus. The story is padded\, but when the padding is this well written\, acted and conceptualised\, and actually serves a narrative purpose to boot\, it doesn't matter in the slightest. The survival mechanics are perhaps unnecessary\, but they are little effort to perform\, and are actually quite immersive in my opinion. The only real criticism I have of the game is that [SPOILERS] the Micah twist feels like a missed opportunity\, as it would make more sense if he had been a rat from the moment he joined the gang\, rather than after returning from Guarma. That's an extremely minor complaint in the grand scheme of things\, however.The game's positives are too many to list\, so I'll try to be as concise as possible. The story is superlatively written and acted by all involved\, no matter the size of the part. Arthur Morgan has become one of my favourite fictional characters in any medium\, and his arc and ultimate demise is heartbreaking in the best way possible. The game is one of the most breathtaking I've ever seen\, with a ridiculous amount of detail and realism packed into every fibre of its visuals. The guns look\, sound\, and feel amazing to shoot\, allowing you to live out your Wild West fantasies in the most explosively entertaining way possible. The numerous side activities are all great fun\, but the unquestioned highlights are the stranger missions\, which include some the game's best characters\, and run the gamut of emotions from hilarious\, to horrifying\, to heartbreaking. The soundtrack\, while perhaps not particularly memorable\, does perfectly encapsulate the atmosphere of the final American frontier\, and Rockstar's use of licensed music is spot on.All in all\, this is one of the generation's very best games\, and one I'll be thinking about long into the future.

The game is technically amazing - beyond comparison. So much care and love has gone into it - and it has pushed my poor PS4 to its limits. There are so many amazing experiences in the game. So many hours of fun and exploration. However\, there's also a lot of banal time-wasting in a sea of nothingness. The real problem with the game is as a sandpit experience it's brilliant. You could live this life and never feel discontent. However\, the game forces you (literally) to take an extremely linear 'scripted' approach to playing that it becomes a war of wills - if you submit to the 'my way or the highway' approach\, then you will enjoy... otherwise you will never get to enjoy what this game offers. For a vast open world game - the 1P experience downright punishes you for being bold. As a result it is programmed for the weakest players to complete - which means you feel like you're playing a TT game more than an open world game. What I found particularly egregious was that you would start an innocuous sounding mission only to find that you are now embarked on a 4 mission marathon... without any opportunity to save or take a pause. Great if you're the only one using the PS4\, but like most people you need to share\, which doesn't work well when you can't save progress or pause between missions. I undestand the narrative pace part... but please... we live in the real world. The other thing that was annoying about this game was that there's never any real increase in difficulty - it's only more and more enemy. To the point where I seriously doubt anyone could keep track of the number of people that Arthur guns down... which is at complete odds with the whole redemption arc that is forced upon the character. So there's a lot I didn't like (in fact hated) about this game... however\, I WAS one of those that was prepared to just invest my time in the 'experience' and go along for the ride. Oh - but if you've not played it... the one advice I would give is that don't worry about money - or how to spend it. This is perhaps the most badly designed part of the game as it completely undermines the entire premise of the story. Stoopid. Just completely stoopid. As a I right this - I wonder why I gave it a 9... but it's for all those moments of joy... and just cringe-worthy fantasy-living experiences.Edit - on reflection\, I actually think the limitations and constraints imposed on the 1P game really detract from the experience - in an otherwise brilliant game: dropped from 9/10 to 8/10… Expand",True,0.21107252,0.0126394415,0.03249594,0.061101943,0.15938593,0.016810767

The attention to detail is well documented and you can see the amount of work put into the graphics and the open world. The story kept me engaged and wanting to get to the next part of the story to see what happens next. I was invested in the characters. I genuinely liked some of them and disliked some of them. The story will grab your attention for sure. I found the game play to be very good. Sometimes the controls got a little bit tricky\, running gave me a hard time for awhile until I got used to it. gun play was great. You can tweek the difficulty of  it to your suiting. You can keep it simple with an auto aim\, that does make head shots extremely easy\, or you can turn it off and make it more difficult. However you like to fit your play style. There are a ton of weapons in the game\, although I think most people\, like me will find a few that they like the best and will stick with those throughout. I found the weapon wheel easy to navigate and not to clunky. I also like the fact that there are no micro-transactions for the single player mode.

Even though the world is so open you can do anything you want\, playing like a bandit and wrecking things the GTA way becomes extremely punishing. While you can perform robberies in any store\, it is often not a good idea to do so since this game will punish does acts more than it rewards them. You’re almost forced to stay on track and be a good sport if you want to move ahead. Outdated mission design that feels last gen. The story is good it goes on for too long and parts of it feels unnecessary. Horseback riding is a drag and there is almost no fast travel. You’ll end up riding around A LOT.The ugly: I actually like the controls and mission design of GTA 5 better than RDR 2. And GTA 5 was released by the same developer in 2014.Verdict: Very memorable game\, but it comes with some major gameplay frustrations which makes what could have been the best game ever made feel like a remaster of a PS3 game which is already outdated on release.… Expand",True,0.15213956,0.0075912476,0.036878675,0.036325075,0.10549548,0.018882722

One minuscule mishap\, and the whole town is shooting you down\, and you end up with $100s in bounty - that's a lot of 50¢ animal pelts.  From now on\, every one shoots you on sight\, so good luck completing missions to get money.Every single action has a long press. Why? Fishing has the same button to fish and to put away your gear. Means you always put your gear away when trying to fish.Everything feels so slow and sluggish. There are so many things to do\, but I don't want to do any of them. Walking around in Rocky terrain is so stressful. The character howls in pain when falling off from a height of a foot or two. Rising is soooo dull. Fetch this there. Talk to the person at the other end of the map. Fetch this letter at the other end. Catch that guy or another.

The Abigail missions on the main track are so dumb. Basically women are portrayed as harpies that make men run around to save the day. \""Save my son\"" \""buy this ranch for me or I leave you\""This is not a game\, it's a cowboy simulator.

They wanted the game to feel very deliberate and they do this by making things go slowly. You need to actually travel around for the most part-fast travel is hardly a fast travel. You have to be in camp and it will take you somewhere\, but you need to trek it back to base again. This is great at times since the world is so amazing\, but I just wish there was some kind of fast travel towards the end of the game. Not everyone has 1000000 hours to run around the world map.Another issue is with hunting. It can be very hard to see certain animals and hard to hit em. Some of em aren't too bad\, but smaller critters can be a nightmare. The other issue is with having to haul large animals back to a specific NPC one at a time....this is such a drag. I know it is more realistic\, but you have to set boundaries with realism in a video game. Sometimes things are better off not being real. Think about if you got shot once in the game and you were dead-now that wouldn't be very fun\, but it is a lot more realistic.The gunplay is great for the most part but also a hassle with switching weapons and the game constantly putting them back on your horse. This was a minor annoyance\, but as the game went on it was like a small itch that you just can't scratch. On top of that on horseback it can be hard as hell to aim\, so you will be using your dead eye a lot.Overall: 9.8/10    I love this game and I highly recommend it. It is slow and it is deliberate\, but it is worth it. If you have low patience levels though\, don't even bother because you wont make it far.

Not being able to run in camp\, horses slowing down and sprint becoming disabled randomly throughout missions\, poor choice of controls\, a pointless core system which is completely unnecessary and overly complicated\, randomly falling of horses which choose randomly when to jump over a crash or to ignore it. Also\,  there are way to many collectibles (cave drawings\, dreamcatchers\, cards\, dinosaur bones and more). Why have them? They all amount to the same thing - googling the location and travelling there on your horse (which again\, can be a nightmare). The treasure hunting was a very welcoming side quest as each treasure gives a clue to the next's location (adding actual gameplay value).I couldn't pinpoint the exact problem - but riding through a town or city was an eyesore and produced headaches.

The way a bullet from the slug of a double barrel scatters after being fired point blank\, with a thunderous roar as limbs fly off from within your vicinity. It's pretty awesome\, but the cover system is completely broken and a huge downgrade from the first one.

The soundtrack is universally excellent\, from old western folk ballads that make traversing the world more immersive\, to the brilliant guitar notes and heavy drums that fire off as soon as combat erupts into a lively and deadly shootout. Back to the story\, the first four chapters are among the best storytelling in any game\, its extremely enthralling and incredibly nuanced. We follow a group of outlaws and outcasts trying to survive and escape a world that has changed with the times\, and the remnants of remaining outlaws dwindle as civilization closes in. The dichotomy between Arthur and Dutch was riveting at times\, both men raised and indebted to their idealistic beleifs and struggles that clash and erupt in front of them as soon as they're fed up with system that always catches up with them\, as both men desperately yearn to get away from it. We see a man deteriorate in front of us and another man grow and change into a kind hearted\, but superficial killer (depending on your choices.) After these four chapters\, the games quality takes a nose dive as your forced to cooperate with endless shootouts and tedious trailing missions that grind the games pacing to a dramatic halt. The games design is very linear\, and on missions and some of the side quests in the game\, you never get that sense of accomplishment and pride in trying to approach something on your own. The game constantly leads you to this pathway and it just seems dated. Just as slowly as Arthur doubts and resents his charismatic mentor\, I too was very much annoyed by the direction the game went.

In this review\, I will list down the Cons and Pros of this game\, then I will tell you whether you should buy the game or not.CONS:- Bad controls- Outdated game/mission design- They tried to make this game too realistic/sandbox-ish- Horrendous gameplay(Movement mechanics\, and gun-play)- Very tedious- Can sometimes be repetitive- Narrative story pacing issues(the game takes a huge dump at around chapter 5)PROS:- Even though the story has pacing issues\, Red Dead: Redemption 2 still has one of the best narrative stories in video games.- The random encounters and side missions are a lot of fun to play and add to the overall experience.- Every single character in the game is amazing\, relatable\, and lovable. Every one of them has a role to play\, whether it's the main storyline or one of the side stories.- THE VISUAL ASPECT OF THE GAME IS MIND BLOWING!! The game is just TOO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT!!!!!! I played the game in my standard PlayStation 4(PS4) and I am surprised as to how a 4-year-old console is still able to push the game to such high graphical fidelity. The face animations\, the environment\, the weather effects\, everything is just mindblowing. Visually\, there is truly a huge amount of attention to detail.Conclusion: Yes\, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BUY THE DAMN GAME!! It's one of the best games of 2018 and a true game of the year contender. Even though the game has plenty of flaws\, the PROS I mentioned in this review\, do a great job of overshadowing the CONS. I had the same problems with Grand Theft Auto 5(GTA5)\, horrible controls\, horrible gameplay\, and Rockstar still\, to this day\, has not fixed the issues with their controls\, outdated game/mission design\, and gameplay.

But the strive for authenticity take some of the fun from playing in it away. Especially the early hours are very confusing and frustrating\, trying to figure out\, how things work\, why in world this size is no apparent fast travel? Why can't you know the bonus objectives while playing the mission (for the first time)? Why are NPC reacting to you in weird and unexpected way? Why is your character behaving strange? Why are you being chased by the law by bumping into random NPC? It takes time to get used to the mechanics and the controls are quite clumsy and unpredictable. That's bit problematic\, given that the game expects you to interact with the world very carefully or it will fight back your every action until you get back on track.The story is very good\, despite you know (if you played the first game) what the events will eventually lead up to\, but it builds the already-known characters in quite different way and makes them more life-like\, with some genuine motivation for their behaviour\, although not always in positive ways. It would be amazing if they could incorporate the cohesiveness   between the cut-scenes and gameplay like they did in the last God of war\, as the cuts between story bits and gameplay break the immersion\, but that's just nitpicking.

I disagree with the 9-10s and the 0-3s because they are either fanboys or trolls. I agree with constructive praise and criticism focused reviews which is what this is.Pros:- MASSIVE open world - bigger than GTA V.- Long and intense story campaign (70+ hours for me)- Reimagined fast travel mechanics makes you have to ride to your destination(encountering random events or NPC) and makes the game far more IMMERSIVE.- DYNAMIC characters and their actions keeps you at the edge of the seat on anticipation- fun side-activities like poker\, five finger fillet\, train/stagecoach robbery\, NPC encounters with its own story.Cons:- Controls sometimes feel sloppy. Taking cover from a standing position is not smooth.- Can't skip a bath\, grooming horse\, and eating truckloads of food to stay healthy. This serves to make the game more annoying as skipping these chores influences your character stats and has to be done fairly regularly. In my experience\, this served to kill momentum a lot of the time.- Lack of smooth fast travel mechanics in the endgame takes the immersion and adds in a headache since it can take you 7+ minutes to get to your destination.- Long story\, if you work full-time\, this will take you a while to complete since this is a 70-80 hour journey that requires a real commitment if you intend to complete it.This is a GOTY contender. It is a fantastic game where you can spend countless hours immersed in this world. It still has its shares of setbacks.

77969,RDR2,2018-11-06,9.0,"An amazing game and landmark achievement for Rockstar Games. It's truly almost perfect except for a major problem I have.Regarding the Epilogue of the game - I think it was a complete misfire and sloppily done. It's hard not to compare to RDR 1's epilogue but it just pales in comparison in a major way.Looking at RDR 1's epilogue\, it set out on two goals; One\, the player's agency to seek revenge for John's death\, and what better way to achieve that than to play as a grown-up Jack! The second goal was to bring a poignant end to the game that added to the overall theme of the story - violence is fruitless and cyclical - \""People don't forget. Nothing is forgiven\"". This was truly one of the greatest endings to a video game ever\, and it was a shame to see RDR 2 fall so flat. Like 1\, it set two goals: the Player's agency to kill Micah Bell as revenge for Arthur's death. And second\, to set up the events of RDR 1 as you play John Marston.Rockstar surprisingly misses the mark on both points. My two major complaints lie in the length and pay off of the epilogue. First off\, it is WAY too long. RDR 1's had one mission\, 4 check points on the map and you were done. And it was simple and beautiful. RDR 2 however has two parts of an epilogue\, most of it only concerning John's building of the Beecher's Hope ranch\, and it is utterly boring. Character wise as well - John and Abigail are the only ones who further develop their relationship\, wile returning characters like Charles\, Sadie and Uncle really only serve to prop up John's goal of building a better life. What you get are last minute subplots and not too much character development which is a shame. Then\, what really ruined the ending for RDR 2 for me was the final mission.It was totally CHEAP of Rockstar to cheat us out of a final confrontation with Micah\, and instead we have to cower behind cover while we aren't allowed to shoot at him ever. Sadie gets captured like an idiot and then also Dutch appears... for some reason? I thought it was evident Dutch no longer trusted Micah at that point. If he did reconcile\, where did Bill and Javier go? So many plot holes in a single moment and then boom... Dutch shoots Micah anyway and just leaves. Then John and friends go home and happy ending music plays. What a joke\, seriously. Completely took me out of the game. Even worse\, you get stuck playing John Marston if you didn't have a second save as Arthur. Just my opinion in the end but I was really let down with this epilogue.… Expand",True,,,,,,

Nothing too revolutionary\, more or less the standard affair you'd a expect from a Rockstar game\, but solid nonetheless.The mechanics are on a whole other level. The only game I can think of which featured mechanics of a comparable complexity is Kingdom Come: Deliverance. This feeds to my initial point of this game being a slow-paced and deliberate experience. Myriads of factors are at play\, and you have to keep an eye on all of them. From eating\, to keeping your horse and equipment clean. So again\, if you prefer games with a faster pace\, the mechanics could at times appear to be tedious. If on the other hand you're looking to be as immersed as possible\, these mechanics will definately facilitate that.The voice acting and sound design is superb. The voice actors should receive their weight in gold for the performances they've given.If you liked the story of Red Dead Redemption\, you're going to love this one. In a somewhat uncharacteristic direction for Rockstar\, it actually takes itself seriously\, which allows the creativenes of the writers to really shine\, as it doesn't get undercut by the usual sarcasm you'd see in titles like GTA V.tl;drIf you like the idea of being immersed in an authentic and vibrant wolrd while following the engrosing tale of a wild west outlaw\, definatelly buy this.

Overall the game blew me out of the water and the pure scale of the game is just unfathomable\, all that bundled together in a 65 hour story mission package is unbelievable and definitely puts RDR2 at the top of best video games ever made.… Expand",True,0.1460314,0.008354187,0.024198212,0.035333443,0.092279755,0.019055385

Arthur Morgan is an excellent character and one that will be remembered like John Marston. The one area where this game falters a little is the combat.

The way the music drifts in and out matching the things you are doing in the world really enhances the experience. The excitement of old world gun fights and surviving of the land really makes this game a standout in this generation.As this is a Rockstar game the controls and movement leans closer to realism over twitch accuracy and when I first experienced this movement in GTA 4 and Max Payne 3 I found it off putting\, but as I adapted to it (as intelligent people are able to do)\, I have found it to be incredibly intuitive and gives the overall game play a level of immersion and satisfaction that you dont find often in control schemes. Riding a horse through this world is an experience in itself\, it is the most realist interpretation of horse riding and care\, ever in a game and as this is set in the old west you spend a lot of the time on horse back and every time I mount the horse and giddy him up there is a sense of enjoyment.I have found a couple of negatives with the game\, firstly on the PS4 pro the game uses a strange filter or dithering effect to run the game at a higher resolution\, its really detracts for the beautiful game world at times and I really hope the give an option to lower the resolution for a crisper image in the future. The other issue is (Tap A rapidly to move fast) having to tap the A button rapidly to sprint and Gallop does add to the sense on movement and urgency in the game\, but it isnt worth it for the carpel tunnel you get in your hand\, I am getting on in years and I have to stop playing this game due to the pain it causes in my  hand. There is also the issue of the realism of the controls and the animation making it a chore to control Aurther\, there feels like many cheap deaths when Aurther dosent do what you expect because he is reacting to some random object in the environment and all the small animation add up to being extremely irritating to watch after a time.The size of the world\, the graphics\, the psychics\, everything is this game has level of polish and attention to detail that puts every game before it shame.

I’m not sure if horse stuff will get tedious or turn us all into horse loving psychopaths. I mean you had horse medicine and stuff in the first game but it was just like take these horse pills and you get 30s or whatever of your stamina not running out so you can smack the go faster button in a race; now it’s all like a SYSTEM.Hunting now involves going into deadeye mode\, following trails and looking at clues that can be **** or disturbed twigs and if you use the wrong weapon on prey it will **** the meat up like a shotgun on rabbits say.When you get a cougar pelt it doesn’t just go into some bottomless inventory you have to physically put it on the back of your horse and pelts can go bad if you don’t sell them.

This is one of those wonders of a game that will stand the test of time. Pure gold. I have enjoyed many games in my life that have hooked me and been a great experience time after time and many of those being rockstar games. I don't love this game because it is rockstar I love this game because it is straight up the most detailed\, well produced game I have ever played. Even when it come to the big giants like GTA V\, Fallout 4 and any other massive open world game I have seen I have always been a notorious 'I can't be bothered for the missions' kind of player with a huge push needed to drive on through the game but even when I am hooked on exploring in RDR2 I always find my self drawn to the story and the side challenges also.I have never seen detail to such pin point precision. You can feel the emotions from the expressions and fresh\, clean cut dialogue from every character and NPC\, Every building is unique and doesn't have that re-used assets feel and the fact that every single person has something new to say blows me away to the amount of work rockstar put into this game.I see some of those raving on about complex mechanics or things not making sense but no one said the game was going to be easy. The law can seem biased at times but its engaging you get in a fight and flee\, the law is rational to your offense so things like being wanted for a fight are easy to evade and I have seen first hand that the others involved are chased by the law too so don't feel bitter about it and yes if you kill someone and someone see's it\, its hard to stop the law getting involved. What else would I expect?The shops\, the stables\, the map functions\, the stats\, the sheer level of immersion this game gives you is more than I could have ever expected. The fact that you can't take as much if you are hungry\, tiered or wearing snow-clothes in the hot sun all make it feel more and more real by the second and if you don't believe how detailed this is make Arthur starve and not sleep and see the expression and posture he starts to show. It made me feel worn out just looking at him.There's so much in RDR2 I don't feel I could cover it all in a review.Its worth the money\, Its the best game I've ever enjoyed from the start and anyone who is upset about it being more complex than red dead one may need to consider that red dead was stunning but limited by the 360's and the PS3s capabilities and now we can really feel what it was like for John and the Vanderlind gang like you where there. I can not fault rockstar one bit on this one.A massive moment in gaming history.… Expand",True,0.23667802,0.018707745,0.0376521,0.058475737,0.22622968,0.035803676

Even the most mundane of tasks such as bathing yourself rewards the player with stamina XP\, therefore encouraging the player to 'live' as a cowboy would.Each and every single interaction with an NPC feels unique\, sometimes leading the player to unexpected surprises later on in the game\, from getting a reward from them in another town or their family members hunting you down. What Rockstar has shown is that it can create a world that reacts to the player\, and rewards them accordingly\, thus feeding more into the immersive gameplay.The story feels organic with every character in the gang having a unique and believable backstory. Story quests in the game also naturally tend to lead on from each other\, further emphasizing the natural flow of the story and grabbing the player's attention.On top of all this\, we have the main character; Arthur Morgan. Arthur has grown on me throughout my time with the game and has lead to some quite emotional scenes in the story. The great thing about Arthur is that whichever way you go with the Honor system\, Arthur molds perfectly into the embodiment of what the player chooses him to be.The game is massive and at first overwhelming\, but persuades the player to play at their own pace.

The graphics the animation\, the pace the way it almost seamlessly moves from action to cut scene.

If you want a game that you can pick up whenever or actually play through it in a week or take the next 2 years to play it a different way every time\, then this is the game for you.I will give you one example of detail\, I had just got in a shoot out\, shot the guy in the head\, one shot and saw some a 3 star buck in the distance\, so I decided to go hunt the buck well about 5-10 minutes passed and I though well I forgot to loot the body let me see if it is still there.

Time spent in-quest was 80% me not being able to do anything apart from listening in a cutscene or listening to a non-interesting dialogue of a character in walking pace or moderate horse-riding speed while I was annoyed that I was not allowed to ride full speed.The other 20% is just a shout-out and then the quest is over. These shoot-outs were initially pretty enjoyable when I had adjusted the terrible aiming controls and turned off auto-aim entirely. There is however no real progression in the shooting mechanics\, so these shootouts start to feel same-y after a while.Now I probably should mention some positives as well. The landscapes with the lighting can be stunning. The animations and facial expressions are well done (though annoyingly slow when it's gameplay-related). The characters are pretty distinct though I couldn't enjoy any of them\, but this could be because I just felt frustrated with the entire experience.I believe I was in chapter 5 when I stopped playing and watched the ending on youtube. I do hope others have enjoyed this game\, but I cannot believe anybody who likes gameplay or being in control in a game could actually have an enjoyable experience out of Red Dead Redemption 2.… Expand",True,0.11140333,0.0061798096,0.030949092,0.031256735,0.09486605,0.031314444

You are REQUIRED to keep every weapon you've ever picked up on your horse with no way to throw them away\, sell them\, or force a loadout for example\, but your horse is very often unavailable when starting missions.  You can only carry one of the 50 million large pelts you require for crafting around at a time\, but each time you begin the 20 minute horse ride to the drop-off location you lose the pelt to side missions or horse malfunctions or whatever.  It's tiring and unenjoyable and that's the bulk of the game!The actual story has some of the worst pacing in video game history\, with the first hour of gameplay featuring only one gun-fight amid thirty minutes of horseback travel and inconsequential dialog.  It's the kind of thing better games let you skip as cutscenes\, but it sets the stage for an excessively drawn out main campaign.  If you distill the game down into \""main\"" campaign missions\, the campaign length probably drops from 60-ish hours down to less than ten with the only meaningful or memorable bit falling squarely in the third quarter.The game world is fairly bustling\, but it's not even the same planet as something like a GTAV.

The side quests which this game gets praised so much for are nothing special. They are all the same\, requiring you to gather an item or kill some thing. I wonder why a game like Assassin's Creed 3 did not get praised as much as this even though it had meaningful\, story-driven\, well written side quests in 2012? Why didn't that game get similar critical acclaim? Its combat system and characters are also a million times better.Another big problem I have with this game is the Arthur Senses mechanic (another way to say \""Detective Mode\""). This is basically same as the detective mode you find in Arkham games. But unlike those games where that mode is meaningful and helps locate enemies when you are surrounded by dozens of them and do not want to get spotted\, the Witcher 3's Witcher senses serve no purpose. They are mainly used in those 'murder mystery' solving like scenarios where you walk around with the mode and everything is highlighted. You go up to the highlighted item or location and click a button and you do the same until the trail ends. I get no satisfaction out of this type of gameplay. I'm not solving any mystery. I'm just pushing buttons at the place where the game wants me to. Basically\, I'm letting the game play itself.Even its most highly praised quests are the same. You need to find the plan\, a plan to get money who is like a important figure for Dutch so he just goes around asking for her and for a little piece of information they ask him to do a favour for him and this is where the bulk of the game's story is.

The story is pretty interesting and the open world is not only huge but also extremely immersive and full of encounters to make while traveling and events to partake in.The gunplay which plays a big role is really good. There is a total of almost 60 weapons from revolvers to rifles and an extensive customization of each gun. However I don't really understand why you can't buy a gun that is for sale unless you do some story mission or else.I wouldn't say the inventory system is bad but it definitely could use some improvements as finding something in particular can be tricky (especially starting out).Everyone said it at this point but yes\, the game is really beautiful and the fact that while having amazing graphics it is really well optimized with an almost constant 30 FPS (unless you are in a big city for example\, but it's still good)\, it is a sight for sore eyes. You also have to give credit to the incredible amount of details in this game : from the weapons you are carrying moving from side to side\, the environment with the footprints in the snow and the grass moving with the breeze\, It makes the game feel alive and really helps immersing yourself in this world.However the game do have some faults.For instance\, while the main story will keep you interested it is a bit linear. I haven't played the first Red Dead Redemption\, but the I found the witness system a bit extreme as if you press a wrong button you can hit a random person and be wanted for \""unarmed assault\"" or worse. I had some bugs and glitch here and there but nothing game-breaking\, but it's still frustrating when you need to silently takedown someone but pressing the button does nothing. Thankfully your allies do it for you if you take too much time. I also noticed something but after an early mission\, you get a lot of money\, thus breaking the economy a bit as you don't really need much more (unless you plan to buy yourself a lot of clothes and/or weapons)I won't describe every part of the game since many critics have and will do a better job than me\, but overall the game is incredibly enjoyable even though it sometimes feels a bit repetitive and I would highly recommend playing it.… Expand",True,0.123468354,0.0046539307,0.036105253,0.05144889,0.09389619,0.0116639575

You might not be able to change the story significantly\, but whether you choose to do things the good or evil way is a very compelling component to the game. I legitimately felt regret when I was tasked with performing some evil actions to help my gang - not many games are able to evoke an emotional response in me.This is might be my favourite game of all time\, I wanted to give it a 9.5/10\, but settled on a 9 because there is some polishing that could be done.

The latest titles that have come out (RDR 2\, GTA V) have been fixing each other mistakes for each other\, but they both have a common problem. Gameplay. The gameplay in these games are really lacking in opportunity. For example\, you have a box of random pieces of lego that you can build anything out of (MGSV) and on the other hand you have a lego set your mom just bought you for your birthday which looks freaking awesome (RDR2). You first build the store set and you feel it wasn't very fun because you didn't have control of wether you could put a piece in or not. And the instructions are always babying you. Now you begin to play with the big old box of lego pieces. You build a cool ass spaceship\, then you turn that spaceship into a cool ass car\, then you turn that car into a cool ass building. Do you see what I'm going with\, do you understand me you turd.There are many redeeming qualities about this game like the best graphics to ever be put in a form of media\, the immensely engaging story that seems like it was ripped from an oscar and academy award winning film.

Rockstar is sarcastic\, irreverent\, and purposefully politically incorrect. This is true of the GTA series and the original Red Dead. None of that is present here. RDR2 is dour\, serious\, self-congratulatory\, and politically correct to the point of being anachronistic considering that the story takes place in 1898.Playing the game makes me sad\, and I wish developers would get over this whole \""we're not giving you what you want\, we're giving you what you need\"" mentality and just make a game that's fun to play with characters that are fun to inhabit. You want me to be in a western cowboy shoot-em-up but you want me to feel bad about it? Screw you\, guy. Real life is sad and bleak and unsatisfying\, why does my entertainment need to emulate that?Also\, I know I said the main story was too long\, but I really\, really wanted single player DLC where you could play as Sadie\, Charles\, Dutch\, etc. They were all more interesting characters than Arthur. And they didn't have cartoonish Yosemite Sam voices and say \""Sure-ah...\"" 8 million times.… Expand",True,0.25462922,0.0090408325,0.05794714,0.15698463,0.1067334,0.014393489

The game is beautiful\, but once you've ridden around for a while\, it leaves you wanting for something to do besides more chores\, setting up camp\, hunting one animal at a time\, or getting a wanted status for walking by the wrong person in town. I miss RDR 1\, and the sad part is there would have to be a ton of patches and updates to fix this\, so I suppose we can just wait another 8 years to see if Rockstar gets the next one right (if there is a next one).… Expand",True,0.3625127,0.023076924,0.035074018,0.09270445,0.21024476,0.30148876

The whole experience is somewhere between boredom\, and frustration over the broken mechanics\, barely working controls and movement that shouldn't be from this decade. The only thing this game has going for it is the scale and beauty of the map. So if that's enough for you go for it\, but considering how bad the riding mechanics in this game are the enjoyment is usually accompanied by a fair bit of frustration.The game might deserve 2 or 3 as a score but the way they sold and hyped it makes what you actually got just plain insulting.

After 30 hours of play-through\, I can safely say Red Dead 2 is a perfect example of an over-developed game. The hair-splitting attention to detail is indeed unprecedented in modern video games and I commend the development team for their hard-work.But let's be honest\, video games aren't paintings to gaze and admire with deep-thought. Video games are about gameplay and player interaction\, and Rockstar seriously dropped the ball there.Rockstar advertised Red Dead 2 as a successor both in spirit and narrative to the original Red Dead Redemption. Official trailers showed nail-biting train robberies\, intense shoot-outs\, and dynamic player environments in a seemingly limitless world to explore and engage.Except\, the game is none of these things. Yes\, the game is beautiful. Yes\, the voice-acting and narrative is Oscar-worthy. But the gameplay? Sloppy. Unbalanced. Broken. Simply\, not fun.In spite of being offered an inconceivably open-world to explore\, Rockstar forces players to engage an environment ruled by a police state not unlike North Korea. Look at someone too long in Valentine? Bounty. Bump into someone? Bounty. Someone tries to rob you and you defend yourself? Bounty. Fart? Bounty.These bounties make it near impossible to complete missions and continue the story-line. Once killing a lawman\, you can no longer surrender and are essentially banned from entering the most important and interesting areas of the game.Kill a few NPC and rob a horse and you'll have to spend 4-10 hours grinding away to find enough cash to pay off the bounty and play the game.This can't be a design flaw. After 250 million dollars in development costs\, no doubt Rockstar intended the player environment to be exactly as it is.If you anticipate the game to play like a sequel to the first one\, lower your expectations. This game plays like a job rather than something fun and interesting. Hard pass.… Expand",True,0.06025757,0.0026893616,0.015455672,0.024640027,0.043415543,0.011974656
